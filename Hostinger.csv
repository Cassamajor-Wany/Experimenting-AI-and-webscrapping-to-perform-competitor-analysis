"I hate hostinger. I've been trying to log into my account for 20 minutes and it keeps telling me "" Error 1015
You are being rate limited"" and there is no way at all to log in to my account. Hostinger is expensive, they don't care about you once you buy hosting from them, they cheat with prices, you see a very low price at the beginning and then it turns out that this price is only low if you buy for a very long period. No technical support, only a robot. No possibility to log in and blocking access to the account. No clear information when you try to find the necessary information, for example for wordpress optimization or some settings. You have to really struggle to find the necessary tips. This is my last year with Hostinger. Never again!","August 31, 2024",GB
"I've been with Hostinger for many years and I have quite a few domains with them and hosted websites. Suddenly, one of my domains has expired, but I never received a notification is was going to expire (due to Hostinger raising their prices without informing users, I have switched off auto-renewal on my services). While this should not be a problem and I could easily renew the domain, their interface doesn't let me do it, no one of the support team seems to know what's going on, and apparently the team who should handle this technical problem is not available on a weekend??? This downtime is impacting our business seriously at an important time for us and we feel have been let down badly from Hostinger.","August 31, 2024",GB

"I bought a domain name using this company. I was attract from the fact that they allowed restrict content. I have client that want this kind of service. I set a password for my account. When I tried to enter the site refuse the password. I contact the team by email, thinking that was a 5 min issue. They asked to send a request with a SCREEN SHOT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT (how many I have in the bank, my recent transaction etc) to prove that I pay them and a pic of a document. Of course, I cuted out from the bank screenshot all relevant information except the ones relative to the payment. Now I am closed out from site for god know how many days. Minimum 2, according with their email. Speaking with a homo sapiens is out of discussion. Only AI (Artificial Idiot). If the assistence to change a password is so poor I can only immagine the rest.","August 30, 2024",GB

"I have never seen a customer service department refuse to listen to a customer like Hostingers customer service. After twenty (20!!!!) emails back and forth, they finally did what I asked them to do to migrate my site. Then, when I checked the work, the site was messed up and plugins were missing (for instance, the All-In-One backup plugin, the one I used to send over). Many products were distorted. I ended up re-installing the backup that I originally had and that seems to do the trick. I will be paying close attention to the clock to cancel. I do note that when you type in Hostinger Reviews into Google, they come up first, and present only good reviews.","August 27, 2024",US
"I transferred all my domains and migrated three WP websites to Hostinger last year and it was the worst mistake of my life! The process was anything but automated or user friendly and I ended up with multiple errors, including JS and AJAX.PHP errors, which have persisted. The help-bot 'Emily' is useless and my last attempt was aborted after 15 minutes without a response.
In conclusion, I am losing business directly due to the site errors, which effect my theme and my enquiry forms and despite requests for the php error logs from Hostinger, no help has arrived. I will be moving my 7 domains and 3 websites as soon as I can afford to. I do not recommend Hostinger.","August 29, 2024",GB
"This company is either corrupt or just incredibly incompetent. I spent 14 weeks fighting tooth and nail about the frequency of their DDoS attacks, but they did nothing to address the issue. I finally left a review here and sent a legal notice documenting the numerous times our sites were down—every day and then some. Once the review was posted, they reacted and set me up with a reliable server. We went without issues for about 4 weeks, and two days ago, I deleted the review.

Now, the problems have resurfaced. Yesterday, we were down 5 times. Today, we can’t see any graphics and can’t access the drop-down menu on another site. On a good day, they show no concern. They stack servers and have terrible defenses against DDoS attacks. These attacks happen to their IPs constantly, yet they do nothing about it, instead deflecting blame and making excuses about external factors like the wind or sun. They are not even trying to hide their incompetence. When the review is posted, our servers work perfectly. Without it, they fail constantly and daily. Additionally, they buy positive reviews that appear every 6 hours, all of which are fake. They should invest as much effort into providing a reliable product as they do in managing their reputation on Trustpilot.","August 29, 2024",US
They came up with some sanctions (couldn't even explain what they were) and stopped providing a service that was paid for until 2030. They also blocked access to my files.

"Hostinger.com is the ABSOLUTE WORST hosting I've ever had in my life. I transferred from Godaddy to Hostinger because of all these seemingly great reviews online (google) about them. I wish I had the ability to give them (NO stars) at all. They brag and brag about how SECURE they are but I have literally spent (no exaggeration) over 4 hours between last night and this morning (yet AGAIN) trying to get this damn redirect off my site. I have to constantly go back in the back admin to (restore) my site. They want you to jump through countless hoops, buy this protection service and buy that protection service and even AFTER you do so? SAME DAMN THING. Getting an actual human who is a SENIOR MANAGER is damn near impossible and even after you DO get a human and the site is restored and everything seems fine? The next day?

"I have written a detailed review in the Reddit community and they deleted my review and banned my Reddit account.

Instead of providing a proper response or solution to my problems, there whole team will report the post to ban the account from Reddit.

Here are the main points from the review I have posted on Reddit.

1, Hpanel doesn't have a primary option for changing the domain.
2, Support people reply after 10 to 20 mins (each reply)
3, Support people only provide canned responses or knowledge base links.
4, They don't have temporary URLs, like Cloudways or Bluehost.
5, Their migration service is not useful they migrated my 3 websites and found that all the 3 website databases got messed up and mixed up.
6, If Hpanel doesn't have the option to change the URL being the admin their support people should be able to do it. But they won't and they will provide a reply which doesn't make any sense.

After sharing this experience in the Reddit community no one from the team replied to my post instead they reported and banned my account. (Only this post was made in the history of that Reddit account)","January 19, 2024",IN

"Sites go down and customer service always claims it's optimization and never looks into the issues on their infrastructure side.

Reply to Hostinger's comment:

I think it is irresponsible for a company of your size to say that, because you never showed metrics where my site used all of the contracted resources, when looking at the resource usage history, more than 50% of the resources were never used.

You simply said that the problem was with the site, when the site has been running with you for months without any major changes to its structure.

"Hostinger is a scam. DO NOT HOST MULTIPLE WEBSITES WITH HOSTINGER. If there's a problem with one of your sites and it gets suspended, Hostinger will victimize you by banning all your websites without even giving you a backup! And Hostinger customer support will tell you that you agreed to it in their Agreement. Beware of Hostinger, they will bann all your websites without giving you notice if one website is suspended. If you must host your website with Hostinger, don't host more than one website with Hostinger!

If you have 4 websites, Hostinger will lure you to put all of them on one Hosting plan, but if they receive a bad report about one website, they will permanently suspend all your other 3 or more innocent websites. Hostinger is that bad at victimizing their customers! Beware of Hostinger! Never host multiple websites on Hostinger!

"I am deeply disappointed with the way my website was handled by this platform. My site was wrongly suspended due to alleged copyright violations, despite the fact that I am the rightful owner of all the content. I provided clear and detailed proof of my ownership, yet my site remains inaccessible.

The suspension was based on false claims made by others, and despite resolving the issue and proving my case, the platform has yet to lift the suspension. This has caused significant disruption to my work and unfairly penalized me for someone else's dishonesty.

I expected a fair and thorough review process, but instead, I am left frustrated and without access to my site. I urge the company to rectify this mistake and ensure that such unjust suspensions do not happen to others in the future.

I have now subscribed to Siteground which at least you can speak to someone instantly and get the support you need. Unfortunately as i have gone past the 30 day refund policy with Hostinger, it is now a court application as they ignored my request on how to initiate the refund. STAY WELL CLEAR.

What should have been a simple fix for a billing error turned into a nightmare. My website was rendered inaccessible, negatively impacting my business and customer experience. To make matters worse, Hostinger’s support has been unresponsive. Despite multiple attempts to contact them, I have yet to receive a satisfactory resolution, and my domain remains blocked.

Hostinger take payment for services upfront within 2 days without allowing you to test or preview if what they offer will meet your requirements. I discovered you can’t add video backgrounds within your site and cannot easily embed video on your page either without following a lengthy non straight forward procedure. Also they could not provide a ticket counter to track ticket sales to show number of remaining tickets available for sale. And you have to wade through written explanations rather than can watch helpful videos. And getting a refund was not easy to do and was forecast to take 7-15 days. Takes them 2 days to take your money and up to 2 weeks to return it?? Go figure. Anyway suffice to say I was not impressed.,"August 12, 2024",GB

Don't walk, run as fast as you can from this company, they have their agenda and they are sticking to it. I received a reply to my review , however not replying to the data i sent them today of performance experience (Litespeed worked at the backend/wordpress a couple of days ago to address conflicting cache, desktop performance now 98%).

Hostinger requested i agree to a statement today that they will optimise desktop and can't guarantee a significant improvement with mobile (67%)...... ummm is optimising even the problem then?
oh i asked that question, crickets (meaning no reply), just repeating that i agree to the statement regarding desktop.

I think i'll cope without the extra 2% and would much prefer to know why this keeps occurring, how to avoid in future and efforts to fix/optimise mobile performance..... but that's not an option, desktop is the goal. Great, Not!

"VPS hosting plan: leur firewall ne fonctionne pas, je reçois des spams en très grand nombre et impossible de bloquer les ips. Je suis obligé de les bloquer au niveau de Ubuntu avec iptable.
Et à ce stade leur support technique est inexistant, on se contente de me transmettre des informations générales mais le pb n'est visiblement pas sérieusement regardé. inquiétant...

VPS hosting plan: their firewall is not working. I am spammed from ips which I am not able to block using their web interface. I have to block them at OS level. This is huge Security gap.
At that point the support from them is very very poor and I do not feel the issue is investigated. They just close the ticket giving me general information.
This should be a basic feature of my hosting plan and it is not delivered.
I hope I will have the opportunity to change my mind on all this soon...

reply from Hostinger team: they asked me to remove the rule which accepts https traffic from any ips. the problem is, per Hostinger's firewall own design, if I do this then all the traffic is blocked by default.
But if I were to be playful I would say that indeed, since it would block everyone, it would also block the malicious ips, so it is maybe a valid solution...

Conclusion: Ok so the conclusion is the following:
- you have to add a rule to accept HTTP traffic because by default the firewall reject all traffic.
- if you add a rule to drop a particular IP it won't work because of the above rule, and there is no way to set priorities among rules.

So this firewall is just impraticable by design, in case you want to block some ips for your server, unless maybe you want to specify manually ip ranges which excludes your blacklisted ips ( think about doing this for, say, 1000 ips...)

Here is the last condescending comment from customer service when asked about their design:

""
At the moment, we offer self-managed VPS hosting services, so you are responsible for all the work inside the server
I know that managing a VPS on your own might seem tough at first, but I can assure you that if you take some time to learn – you’ll be able to achieve anything!""

Hostinger's Firewall design is not my responsibility.

"Please read my bottom two paragraph added information for my response to Hostinger's reply.

Hostinger has at least two problems. One is false or misleading (at best) advertising - the other is no understanding of customer value - which I still think is important for any business that wants to be viewed as professional and worthy of customer loyalty. I am a very dissapointed current customer. I will be happy to provide more info to anyone interested - but I suspect this review will be sufficient info for you.

I saw your response and I want to make this clear to you and all review readers. If you are offering $20 off a $100 yearly purchase amount, and you are forced to buy a minimum of 2 years, you need to pay $180 and you are getting $20 off a $200 minimum qty purchase. For any educated buyer, they will realize that is a 10% discount, not a 20% discount. Your sales page does not disclose the 2-year minimum purchase. Would it be correct to say you are giving 40% off a six-month purchase which would be the same 10% of the minimum quantity purchase? Because you are Lithuanian-based it must be tempting to skirt truthful advertising laws in the US but that will not result in your being trusted here. I hope you want to, and can do better.

Who is the domain registry? Do they force you to sell at a specified price? Do they force you to offer a 2-year minimum purchase? Do they force you to say that is 20% off?","August 04, 2024",US

"I am ""customer"" of the """"service privider"""" hostinger for 10 years. Every month I need to be fighting with them. They do not respect the ICANN laws. They over charge for domain registration by $4 dollars per domain registration or renewal. They constantly try to charge me to services I already paid, like email, more speed, you name it. Sometimes I register domains and they fail to complete registration BUT they do not refund the funds, they keep them. You need to spend 30 minutes with ""tech support"" to ask why they did not complete domain registration first, then ask manually for the refund. I have lost 5 domains like that, no only the domains for 3 of the fees. Because if you don't keep sharp track of things they will slip their hand into your pocket anytime they can.
Recently I lost a domain because 1) they failed to complete auto-renewal 2) by lay ICANN set grace period of 0-45 days but they scam you in the 10th day, then they buy the domain you want to recover and re-sell it to you on 50 times more the price.

As a refresher, I had signed up for your hosting platform (tinsleybookkeeping.com), then wanted a refund because I wasn't ready yet. I also got an email from you. Before I canceled my account, I created email on my iPhone. Since I canceled, I have not been able to delete the email account. On my iPhone, it gives me no option to delete. Apple support told me I had to contact you to help me. I got a reply from you back on July 11 saying that you had a specialist working on the situation and that you would take care of it. That's the last I've heard from you. You've never contacted me about the situation and because of the problem, I cannot get email on my phone.

I know that sometimes this can happen improperly (even though it is not common), so if you have the proper documents we are able to help you unsuspend it promptly, but if you don't have the proper documentation it means that the terms were indeed violated, and the website will remain suspended.""","April 24, 2024",GB

"we have a 2 page website which is basically trying to build a community to take legal action as a group against a popular trading platform who has been systematically defrauding their clients to the tune of at least £50m over 3 years, we have undisputable evidence and have a complaint with the FCA & FOS, Hostinger suddenly took the site down without any notice before or after stating “Your website is currently not working because the XXXXXXXXXXXXX.com has been suspended due to suspicious activity. To investigate if your order can be unsuspended, please contact us. Our team will handle your case and get back to you” We have checked their terms of business and we have not breached any of their terms, so to cut a long story short, it seems they execute first and if you complain they then start to investigate! to me it shows great care for their clients

Dear Hostinger

We would like to clarify that we are not requesting the unsuspension of our account. However, we are deeply concerned about the handling of this situation.

First, we were not notified prior to the suspension of our website, which is a significant oversight on your part. Furthermore, the reason for the suspension was not clearly communicated to us. We were simply told it was due to ""abuse,"" without any specific details regarding the alleged trademark infringement.

We have thoroughly reviewed the trademark registrations of the company in question and can confirm that our website content does not infringe upon their trademarks. It is particularly concerning that the company alleging infringement has not contacted us directly about this issue. Instead, they chose to go through Hostinger, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. This suspicion is further fuelled by Hostinger's repeated failure to respond to our requests for clarification regarding both the alleged infringement and any possible conflicts of interest.

Moreover, our website's purpose is to organise and support legal action for victims of the other company. This makes Hostinger's actions even more troubling, as they appear to hinder efforts to hold a potentially fraudulent entity accountable.

We expect a prompt and detailed response explaining why Hostinger did not notify us before suspending our account, what the exact nature of the alleged infringement is, and why there has been no direct communication from the company claiming infringement. Additionally, we seek clarification on any potential conflict of interest that Hostinger may have in this matter.

Received on the 08/08/24 from Hostinger

Dear customer,

We thank you for your patience.

We have investigated the case and we can see that we indeed received an abuse report for your website dXXXXXXXXXX212.com. In response to this report, the website was suspended by our automation.

We have now unsuspended the website. Please be assured that the team responsible for the automation is looking into why this happened as well.

We apologise for the inconvenience.

I spent 7 hours yesterday trying to resolve an issue through their chat, but they couldn't fix it. They are incompetent.

The instructions provided are unclear, and you're left to figure things out on your own. If you're not tech-savvy, you're out of luck.

"I recently had the misfortune of using Hostinger's hosting services, and I must say, it was an incredibly frustrating experience. While their pricing might seem attractive, don’t be fooled—what you save in cost, you’ll lose in time and sanity dealing with their abysmal customer support.

From the get-go, I encountered issues with my website's performance, and when I reached out for help, the response times were shockingly slow. Their support team, when they finally replied, was unhelpful and seemed more interested in closing the ticket than actually solving the problem. I was passed around from one agent to another, each one giving me a different (and often incorrect) solution, leaving me more confused than when I started.

The lack of phone support was particularly frustrating, as I had to rely solely on their inadequate chat system. The agents appeared undertrained, with limited technical knowledge, making it impossible to get any real help when things went wrong.

I would strongly advise against using Hostinger if you value your time and need reliable support. The headaches simply aren’t worth it. There are plenty of other hosting providers out there that offer far better customer service and technical support.","July 31, 2024",EG

Let the buyer beware should be your mantra if dealing with Hostinger.

Hostinger doesn't make renewal prices visible in the initial adverts - for hosting or domain names.

This is NOT transparent. It is intentionally misleading.

Hostinger is requesting my personal account information and I am refusing to provide it for fear of retaliation. They could make unlocking my domain names difficult or cause any number of problems for me with my Hostinger account. Basically, I do not trust them at all, in any way.

The chat support totally pounced on me, writing me to choose another domain. Informing them about the violation of consumer rights did not help. They promise X service, do not deliver it, and in the end do not even send an apology. I have never encountered such incompetence from any company in my life. Of course, the matter was reported to the relevant local as well as European authorities. I also made a chargeback of 100% of the amount. It is not worth believing the assurances of this giant on clay legs. At the basic level, their communication is limp, and what must be going on inside? We're all guessing.","April 11, 2024",PL

"Ticket ID: #108493

I am extremely disappointed with Hostinger's hosting service and their so-called technical team. My experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.

I requested a website transfer from one Hostinger account to another for my website. Despite numerous follow-ups and assurances of urgency, this simple task, which should have taken no more than 20 minutes, has remained incomplete for over a week. It has been more than 8 days since I opened the ticket, and my hosting has expired while the website transfer remains unresolved. This level of incompetence is simply unacceptable.

The lack of efficiency and communication has caused my hosting to expire, exacerbating the problem. The so-called technical support team appears more focused on offering empty apologies than on actually resolving the issue.

If you're considering Hostinger, beware. They lack the professionalism and capability to handle even the simplest requests. Based on my experience, I strongly advise seeking a more reliable hosting provider.

I will be moving all my domains and websites to a more dependable registrar and would not recommend Hostinger to anyone. Save yourself the frustration and choose a provider that values its customers and their time.","July 09, 2024",IN

"I had no problem with Hostinger while using it from the home office. However, while on a business trip to Guatemala, I was locked out because of an unannounced system change requiring a second verification step. This was added after I left home and before I arrived some 15 hours later. Their system and customer support was unable to send the required code by email or phone message. The alternative requirement was that I provide a photo of a card used 2 years ago which was compromised and replaced, from Guatemala. There was no other solution available. I won't return home for 15 days, so have no way of knowing if the new additional requirement is only while traveling or at home too. If so, I will not be able to use their services that I have paid for, as there is no feasible way that they will accept to verify the second step and they can not send a code to alternate emails or phone.
UPDATE: I found an alternative way to access the email only. Hostinger was sending the access code to the Hostinger email account I could not access. Not sure what or if they were thinking.","July 11, 2024",GB

"Hi Hostinger team,

I appreciate the website builder, but there’s a major issue with the video aspect. When uploading a video, it appears unprofessional due to a popup button directing users to Google Drive. The alternative options, such as YouTube links (what if clients don’t have YouTube accounts/videos) and embedded codes have bugs and problems.

Please consider adding a simple option to upload videos directly from a computer, similar to Wix. This change would be a game-changer for me and my clients, allowing us to stick with Hostinger for all our website needs. Videos are a significant aspect of websites as it helps make a website more intriguing and engaging. This flaw with Hostinger has me using other website building alternatives for most my clients.

Thank you for your consideration!","July 11, 2024",MK
"NOTE; Hostinger replied to my review last week on July 11. They said they had someone working on it. It's now the 19th and I have not heard from then directly about resolving the situation.

I had heard good things about Hostinger, but their customer service sucks. I first sent the message below back on June 27 to support. I heard nothing. I then sent the message again on July 2, and have heard nothing and here I was thinking that once I am ready to put up a website, I would use them. Not sure that's possible now.

Under the domain name, tinsleybookkeeping.com, I signed up for Internet hosting services last week. Also included with the package was an email account, which I also signed up for. I used the QR code provided to install the email protocol on my iPhone. I then deleted my account because I wasn't ready to build a website yet. As part of the Account deletion protocol, it was mentioned that my email would no longer be in service.

Earlier this afternoon, I purchased the same domain name mentioned above along with the same email. When I attempted to delete the (Hostinger) email account from my iphone, there was no ""delete"" option available. Instead, the following message is there; ""These settings are installed by the profile ""Mail account tinsleybookkeeping.com""""

I contacted Apple support about my dilemma. They told me to contact you. I need to have this email account deleted from my mail settings so I can re-create it with my new provider.","June 26, 2024",US

"Nightmare Experience with Hostinger – A Warning to Potential Customers

I am utterly disappointed and frustrated with the abysmal service provided by Hostinger. For over a month now, my websites babouches-kech.com and kech-handmade.com have been inaccessible due to an internal bug caused by Hostinger's incompetence. These websites are not just a personal project, they are my sole source of income, and Hostinger's negligence has cost me dearly.

The ordeal doesn't end there. Every time I reach out to Hostinger's customer service for assistance, I am thrown into a never-ending loop of redirection. Each agent I speak to asks me to wait, only to pass me on to another agent, forcing me to re-explain the issue from scratch. This cycle repeats ad nauseam, with no resolution in sight.

To make matters worse, Hostinger claims to have lost my data, leaving me without a working backup to restore my websites. The sheer incompetence and lack of accountability displayed by Hostinger is truly appalling.

I have no doubt that someone from Hostinger's team will attempt to discredit this review with false promises and excuses. But the truth speaks for itself – just try accessing babouches-kech.com and kech-handmade.com, and you will see that they remain inaccessible to this day.

I write this review as a cautionary tale to prospective customers: Hostinger is a nightmare to deal with. Stay away if you value your website's functionality and your sanity.","June 07, 2024",MA

The only option provided was to re-install the VPS, which would wipe everything, including the snapshots. This meant that I had to manually back up everything and then upload it again, which was extremely inconvenient and difficult.

I'm confused as to why the option to transfer the VPS from one location to another was removed, especially when it's a useful feature for moving files and snapshots.

I have a webshop at Hostinger, used to be Zyro, for at least two years now. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I still have it Purly because I worked very hard on it, spent many many hours on it, and it's finally OK now.

Hostinger is not easy to use. I can't find basic stuff like rearranging products to your liking. There are FAQ's but even those don't work sometimes. For example : I'm selling digital downloadable images. But Hostinger doesn't have the basic option to not enlarge the picture when you click on it. So people can click on it, have it big, and make a screenshot.
I have had many chats with the AI chat and in real live chats. They frequently say that they don't have functions available yet. Basic functions!
Also I have to switch browsers sometimes because sometimes things don't work on Chrome. Imagine all the time I put into figuring this out....

Also, it took more than a year to finally have my description of my Internet page right. Yes, I also chatted with someone from Hostinger about it, they said they couldn't do anything about it. It took a year of waiting!

Now another thing. My website isn't always working for the public. I even got emails from buyer that they couldn't see my products. After I went to the website builder and did absolutely nothing, things got right again. But I don't want to check my website everytime just to make sure it's working properly.

"I have been a Hostinger customer for the past 7 months, and overall, my experience has been quite positive. The service and customer support have been excellent and beyond my expectations. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making managing my site a breeze. Plus, the pricing is very competitive for the high-quality service they provide.

However, I recently encountered an issue that has left me feeling disappointed. When I initially signed up, I had several conversations with Hostinger representatives and conducted thorough research. I was assured by multiple representatives and their AI support that upgrading to meet my future needs would be straightforward, especially as my websites grow and require more resources, such as adding large content like videos. Based on these assurances, I felt confident in choosing Hostinger for my business.

Now, as my business needs have evolved, I find myself needing to upgrade from the Cloud Startup plan to a VPS hosting plan. Unfortunately, I have been informed that this upgrade is not possible at all.

Hostinger sent an email (just one email) they'll move my server. OK, that acceptable... sort of. I'd expect more time or more reminders.

The catch?
- they won't share the IP where the site will go until it happens
- they won't share when it's going to happen but left a day long period

This effectively made my websites go down, because I wasn't available when the server changed.

This is absolutely unacceptable. I can't fathom who gave greenlight to this workflow.

Just think about that discussion:

'hey we need to move some servers.

OK when it's going to happen?

We don't know exactly, but we know a rough date.

Ok notify the customers just once, send them an email and don't tell them anything just explain the impact. And tell them to be ready.

This is impactful, email can end up in spam or not being delivered or missed easily. Shall we do some more communication points?

No, just one email, weeks ahead. It's enough.

Shall we offer some buffer period or at least an IP address of the server or any detail?

No, they can probably wait entire day for our email and they can act once we send the notification of change (via email again.) '

Customer orientation 0, customer focus 0, customer empathy 0.

Products are ok, but it's hosting. All hosting' providers are almost the same these days. It's the help that matters at the most important moments.

I will definitely move my websites elsewhere.

Whoever responds to these is probably a member of marketing team. Tell your managers, leaders, to have a bigger say in what kind of communication actually goes to customers. Be the voice of the customer in that room where stupid decisions like these above are made.","June 26, 2024",CZ
"I consider myself a hosting and networking vet, having use many different company over the years.

Hostinger makes big promises when they advertise their plans. They say you can have 2 cores , 250 nvme storage, 3GB Ram,
Unlimited Databases, 100 PHP Workers, 2M inodes, up to 300 websites, fast WordPress sites, etc., but that's not really true if you use only WordPress sites.

They have a secret limitation on the hard drive usage that they don't readily tell you about at the time when you buy any of their Cloud Plans. (hostinger-com/cloud-hosting)

This SECRET limit is called Throughput I/O of ONLY 10,000 KB.. Yes that is Kilobytes.

Even though a server hard drive can handle a lot more throughput, they only let it process this small amount of data as you add your websites.

This limit will slow down all your websites, even though they say you can have up to 300 sites, when really you can't get past 4 or 5 comfortably. You'll keep getting errors like 200, 403, and 502, and you'll lose clients because of it. And Hostinger will blame it on your sites, your plugins, lack of caching, etc., when really there is no true way you can find where the usages are coming from, and which sites... If this is even true. Their excuse is that they have to have this limitation in place for other users.... Ok, wait! The cloud Plan I purchased isn't some cheap Shared-hosting plan so why would they tell me that??

This Throughput I/O limitation is NOT even in their hosting agreement (hostinger-com/legal/hosting-agreement). Check for yourself.

Just one WordPress site install can actually hit this limit. Why do Hostinger have this limit when other hosting companies don't usually have this kind of limitation. I lost $425 and a client because of this problem.

So far I request a refund for the lack of informing the customer before buying, and so far they have denied me, and even denied to even remove this limitation off. So instead of them taking care of a spending customer, they rather allow users to go ahead submit reviews, that will inform others about this carefully hidden issue.

I don't recommend Hostinger. If a price is too good to be true. Believe it.

Instead, my recommendation is to go with one of the big six: AWS, Google cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, Vultr, or Linode. Use some server management software like CloudPanel, etc., to freely manage any these. You'll get better service without any limitations.

Thanks for listening.
If you have experienced this same issue (or similar) with Hostinger please let us know. Hopefully Hostinger will soon do something the rectify this issue.","June 19, 2024",US

"Complaint
Dear Hostinger Representatives,
I am officially lodging a complaint with your company.

On June 23, 2024, our website became inaccessible to visitors. We had received no prior notification or warning from you about this issue. We only learned about it when our customers began informing us that they could not access our site.
Upon checking our account dashboard, we found the following message:

""Hosting plan is suspended
Your website is currently not working because the has been suspended due to suspicious activity. To investigate if your order can be unsuspended, please contact us. Our team will handle your case and get back to you shortly.""

We subsequently reached out to you requesting the restoration of our hosting service and clarification regarding the suspension. In response, we received the following message from you:

""Hello,
Thank you for reaching us.
Regarding the suspension, I have forwarded your case to our Abuse team for review.
As it requires a deep investigation, it might take up to 5 business days for the relevant team to provide an update.
No worries, we will inform you the moment we have more information!
This chat will reopen automatically and you will receive an email with all the relevant details. You can also track the status of this ticket in the Help page of hPanel, like so.""

As an online store, we cannot afford to wait for such a prolonged period for your response. Waiting for 5 business days will cause us significant financial losses, and we will be seeking compensation from your company for these losses:
1) To avoid substantial losses, we urgently request that you restore our hosting service as soon as possible!
2) Additionally, we are unable to access our database and our files. These are our commercial property. Therefore, we urgently request that you provide us with access to our database and files!
We hope for your prompt assistance in resolving this issue.","June 23, 2024",BG

"Absolutely the worst experience imaginable. Everything doesn’t work properly at best and the included email address only sent customers enquires to me. All the replies were rejected by both hotmail and gmail. Lost over a weeks business from my contact form submissions and it total wrecked my google conversion tracking. The worst part was nearly 3 hours on their chat with a person whose amazing arrogance could not fix the problem. They even tried telling me that I had to spam all the lost customers for them to fix it. The only thing they could do was insist that it must be my fault because ‘their software works’. It might be cheap but there’s a reason for that and your business will suffer if you don’t choose a better hosting company. You were warned

"All I can say is unbelievable!

I don’t know where to start, had so many issues in past few years.

I get a resource notification that I need to upgrade my cloud hosting. The problem is that its coming from Disk Usage. My current Disk Usage is 2%, lolo I am using 5GB out of 250GB. HUH? How on earth can I be using too much disk space when I use like 2 % of it?

Not just that, a few days ago I could not even load any website and then after so much time with support, they finally decided to move my hosting to another server. The very next day I go to the websites to work on WordPress site, and it freezes up, then I check the rest of the websites and sure enough, wont load or extremely slow. I contact support and must wait and try to get a real person as thew BOT Emily keeps on posting issues with optimization on websites. I have had these same websites up and running VERY optimized without many issues in the past year except server concerns. I run WP Rocket and always optimize all my websites as I have been doing this for over 15 years. On a side note, same technology running on c panel shows almost perfect results in Lighthouse and speed test such as GTMetrix. I also have tested all the sites with same tools on this Hostinger Cloud server and same thing, great results but they keep on coming back and coming up with excuses.

I am not one to make complaints or reviews, but I have had it with their excuses. It does not seem to help when I contact support as I get know where with MOST of them. Some support staff is very helpful like DIEGO, very knowledgeable and always willing to help.
If you look at my resou7rce usage, its such a joke as I am barely using anything. In fact, I have even deleted some websites I don’t host anymore, and it seems like the lower the websites, the more issues.
Here are some details about all resources - 12% of resources used in the last 24 hours.
Here are the details about the so-called resource limit reached - Disk usage limits peaked 40 minutes. I am ONLY using 2% so how on earth can this be?

The cost is great, but you get what you pay for and in this case, I am not even getting that in my opinion. I asked to speak with supervisor, nope, I asked for management email, nope. You can’t even make a complaint to anyone. So, this brings me to this review. I need to warn others. This is the email I got just before this review - Action needed: You have outgrown your hosting plan. I have no idea how this could be true as I don’t even come close to outgrowing my resources.

UPDATE *****
OK, so the issues continue to happen…
This morning, I logged into TWO websites to do some WordPress updates on the plugins. The sites started to bow down again and at times, gave me a 500 error and would not load. Contacted support, took a LONG time to get someone and after she looked at it, came back with a link to optimize my websites and showed images of spiked resource for memory. I looked at it and it was from the resource levels, my average memory used is 500 MB, I have or suppose to have 6144 memory with my hosting. It spiked to 900 MB, I am suppose to have 6144 memory. HUH? How on earth would this cause my websites to not load? Also, checked the CPU and it spiked to 22 %, don’t I have like 78% left?

Not even close to going to my limits. My websites are also to 95% speed all the time and all my images are ALWAYS optimized. I have been doing this for many years and its like they don’t think I know what I am doing. Even with spikes in traffic or DDOS attacks, the resources show that I should have plenty to accomodate and get the websites ot load decently.

Look at the disk space, I was also getting a notice saying I needed to upgrade my hosting because disk space was reaching limits. I am at 3% disk Space - what? but they wanted me to upgrade my service because I was using 2-3% disk space.

PLEASE be mindful when using these people as in my opinion its not worth the stress and headache and I am moving my websites out and will loose close to 1 year left of service, but the stress is not worth staying and having my clients get upset because their websites won’t load.","June 20, 2024",IN
"The only reason this isn't 1 star is because they are cheap.

Our email accounts were hacked. All of them. Pretty nutty because the main service is via a gmail and I know that this one wasn't hacked. Tried to change everything up, nothing. We spent probably 100 hours on our side tracing down problems to fix it with no customer support.

Today? Well, Hostinger decided to block my hope IP address without warning. I am still on hold for 25 minutes in a chat where nobody has responded. I can't access my emails without a VPN. Pretty bad. Really, really bad.

Pretty much every month there is a new problem that arises. I couldn't tell you what or why. I can just tell you that you will continually be chasing problems if you actually use Hostinger for anything but a junko, cheap website.

"I submitted a ticket for account email change and they asked for way more data than they should or need given what they already have stored on their system. Proof of purchase and I accepted but plus a form of photo ID, why!!!?. I said no to photo ID, so they asked for the payment credit card photo showing only the last four digits plus the account's holder name. I sent a photo of the payment card showing the name of my manager as I purchased the product for my department plus a photo of one of my credit cards only showing my name. Still after all the effort I made they just closed the ticket and left the request pending for over a month now. I contacted them at least three times just to be asked to fill in the same form and upload the same evidence over and over and over again with a promise someone will get back within two business days. I am aware they are struggling to accept my challenging their request for a photo ID and I will never do as turning a web hosting service into an intelligence gathering agency is not what Hostinger has been authorised to operate in the UK for.

There was no further explanation provided, and to make matters worse, I did not receive a refund for the domain that was taken away from me.

I strongly advise against risking purchasing a domain from this company. Their arbitrary removal of domains without clear justification or recourse is completely unacceptable.

"I would not recommend using Hostinger. Pay close attention to what others are saying. When selecting a hosting, I saw a negative review of Hostinger and dismissed it as an exception. Unfortunately, my experience proved otherwise.

I purchased a domain through Hostinger and built a personal website, investing significant time and effort. However, just three days after launching, my site was suspended. Hostinger accused me of violating their terms and conditions due to a trademark issue with another company that had a similar name to my domain. I was completely unaware of the existence of this other company.

It turned out that the domain name suggested by Hostinger's recommendation engine appeared to violate someone else's trademark. How was I supposed to know this if Hostinger itself didn’t initially identify the domain name as an issue?

Hostinger also suspended my access to all the source code for my website, which did not violate any terms and represented a week's worth of work. I have been unable to regain access and now face the prospect of rebuilding everything from scratch. In addition, I was waiting a week for them to review my case and it was just a time lost. Hostinger refused to lift the suspension and showed no interest in negotiating. They also declined to refund my purchase or provide another domain and migrate the source code.
As a business owner and manager, I find their level of service unacceptable and unprofessional, especially for a company of Hostinger's size. I would strongly recommend passing them by.","June 16, 2024",AR
Do NOT use them for domain transfers. The price they mention and that is mentioned on several comparing websites is the price for transferring the domain without extension. All other registrars include a year extension and therefore mention the full price. Hostinger hits you with an additional charge for the extension later on.

"After months of problems with Hostgator VPS, I've decided to change to Hostinger and guess what? Problems... I love Hostinger VPS, but when you face a problem, they don't care if all your websites are offline, my websites have been offline since yesterday, and first thing in the morning when I'm checked again... same thing, call for support all the sites offline and no solutions, they've said that they are investigating but never found a solution and my website follows ALL OFFLINE til the moment!!!
Looking at the documentation on Hostinger I found something about the CPU usage, which I think is my problem, so they say...

""CPU
When you reach the maximum threshold for available CPU, your website becomes slower and starts scheduling requests from your visitors instead of serving them instantly. There will be no error messages, but the website will feel sluggish.

Find out your website's peak hours and ensure your CPU stays below 80% during the busiest times. This will guarantee that all visitors have the best possible experience on your website. ""

But they didn't mention in the documentation that they will cut you off and all websites on your VPS will be shutting down, which is my case.

Resume of the history, if you are in a shared host on Hostinger and things go well DON'T MIGRATE TO VPS! End of the story, on HostGator I've problems with memory usage, on Hostinger is CPU so, be careful when you decide to change!!!

End of the day and things are going as same, even after the Hostinger reply, they did do nothing about it, so if you see a reply in bad reviews, know that is like a robot replying, already stopped my server by now and put all my websites to sleep because my VPS SERVER KVM 2 simply not work, another thing that I clarifying here is that on my VPS Panel I have the upgrade button but the downgrade is missing... So... The support does nothing to help, and if you upgrade your server, there is no way to downgrade besides speaking with chat support that does nothing, be advised!!!!

They shut down my VPS, all my websites are offline, and nobody is doing anything to help solving the situation, my VPS is not manageable because of high usage of CPU and I can do nothing, so the only way to work on the problem is to upgrade, but if I upgrade that's no way back, I need to buy a new VPS and start all the configuration aand migration of files to the new VPS, now answer me, this a way to work on a hosting company? Put your client in a position where they can do nothing to solve a problem and nobody does anything to help. Worst company ever, if the services are working ok, if you have a problem you`re dead!!!

The gateway did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or application.

This is what HOSTINGER will do for your business!

Update 06-18-2024I still have the same problems with Hostinger's policy to put all websites on a VPS to sleep, here is the thing, if your VPS gets to 100% of CPU usage, they will put all your websites on your VPS to sleep, yes, on your Hostinger panel will appear that your server has a restriction and all your websites will be offline and with this restriction you will not able to do nothing and the VPS team, the only people that can help you out will take 3 days to respond one ticket and in my case, even when they respond telling that the problem was solved, my websites were offline, so last week I've decided to delete everything, and after reinstall all again, I start today having same issues with the server, so be advised, if you have a VPS and your server get 100% of CPU usage they will put down all the websites on your VPS and put a restriction so you will not able to do anything...

Waiting so many hours without service for this response is not worth the money.

Their servers are not reliable in their technical capabilities and no matter how many VPS you have, speed is no guarantee, much less being able to have the website online due to its own absurd limitations.

"Hostinger Hosting Service Review: An Exercise in Frustration
I recently transitioned all my websites to Hostinger for hosting and even purchased several domains from them, only to be met with a deeply disappointing experience. Their customer service is, frankly, abysmal unless you’re looking to earn a degree in web hosting.

Customer Service: A Nightmare
Hostinger’s lack of contact numbers is the first red flag. They boast a 24/7 chat box for support, but all you get are written instructions. This so-called ""support"" feels more like an online tutorial than actual assistance. You're essentially taught to solve issues yourself, turning a simple query into a frustrating ordeal. By the time you’re done, not only do you detest the chat box, but you also grow to resent the company as a whole.

Non-Responsive Leadership
I even reached out to the CEO in hopes of finding a resolution, but received no response. Having spent my life in the business world, I know the importance of responding to service issues. This CEO appears to be completely detached from customer concerns, which is unacceptable.

False Advertising
Hostinger’s advertising is, in my opinion, not worth the paper it’s written on. They promise a seamless experience but fail to deliver on basic customer service. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" rings true here—they provide the hosting infrastructure but offer no real help beyond that.

The Bottom Line
If you’re not interested in obtaining a Master's degree in IT and website management, I’d strongly advise looking elsewhere for hosting services. Find a company that offers genuine help and customer service. Hostinger provides virtually none, leaving you to navigate a frustrating mess on your own.

In conclusion, don't just walk away from Hostinger—run. Their lack of effective support and misleading advertising make them a poor choice for hosting services. Save yourself the headache and find a provider that truly values their customers.","June 05, 2024",US

"After I wrote my previous review and provided account name via Trustpilot, Hostinger never got back to me, they stopped responding to my emails, they even stopped responding to support chat inside their system.
So now I have an account with dozens of domains which will be probably blocked in a few days without any valid reason.
I never made anything unlawlful, I provided documents for their requests which required paying money to get statements.
I never experienced such attitude from any company! Very, very disappointed!
Recommend to anybody to stay away from Hostinger.com!","June 05, 2024",US
The reviews here are FAKE They have NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. A Terrible company AVOID AT ALL COSTS...,"June 05, 2024",AM
"Yesterday from 8 PM, there was no service availability. Our store went down, and Hostinger didn't even inform us about it. Only today, around 9 AM, they restored the store from the previous day's backup, so all orders from yesterday disappeared, and Hostinger offered us an additional 10 days of free service as compensation. We have purchased the highest service package, yet they treat us like an unimportant customer and disregard our reputational losses and the fact that we lost an entire day in the system and are unable to recover it. This is what their backup and support look like. They keep passing us to another person and completely ignore our problems caused by them. In such issues, the support is disastrous, and the company takes no responsibility for anything. Moreover, there are more such outages, usually lasting several dozen minutes, but this time they outdid themselves; we lost customer data and were left completely alone. Don't believe their claims about availability and full security.

Another day has passed, and we are still cleaning up after the data loss caused by Hostinger. As a laughable compensation, they first offered to extend our subscription by 7 days, then 10 days, then another person offered 7 days again, and yesterday it was a WHOLE 2 months, which at our rate is worth about 50 EUR. Meanwhile, we continue to bear the consequences of their lack of security and waste our time. If you really don't want to lose your valuable data, do not use this provider. If this is how their security measures against failures look, resulting in customer data loss, then good luck.
P.S. We still have no contact with anyone in management despite numerous requests, and we still haven't received a fair compensation proposal.","June 05, 2024",GB

Overall I lost money with the transition for this unnecessary rule against Venezuelan, this being the only hosting service to take this sudden decision.

"I am extremely disappointed with Hostinger. After purchasing a VPS subscription, web hosting, and a domain from them, I quickly realized that their VPS hosting was not what I needed. I canceled my VPS hosting and web hosting on the same day and switched to A2 Hosting for managed hosting.

During the process of transferring my domain to A2 Hosting, something went wrong. Hostinger informed me that my domain was marked as spam for unknown reasons. This is unacceptable. It is not normal for this to happen during a simple transfer process. I believe that this issue arose because of Hostinger's handling of the transfer.

I got the domain name only three days ago and decided to switch hosting providers, and now my domain is unfairly marked as spam. Hostinger needs to take responsibility for this problem. Their poor handling of the transfer has caused significant delays and frustration.

I would not recommend Hostinger to anyone looking for reliable hosting services. Their actions have been incredibly unprofessional and have caused me unnecessary trouble.","June 04, 2024",NL
"Used Hostinger for 7 months without issue. Then one day they had scheduled in some maintenance to my server (without communicating this with me). They said the maintenance was complete without any issue, but my entire website was 404’d.

You can only contact customer service via email and - unsurprisingly - this is not a quick way to get your website back up and running. Despite claiming they respond within 1 business day, I am still yet to receive a response to any of my emails of complaint from 7+ days ago.

It was easier and simpler for me and my business to just migrate my website elsewhere. That is the only way my issue was resolved.

"I have been using Hostinger's business hosting for almost a year. Recently, my business website and all its subdomains (which I use as test servers to host my clients' websites) were suddenly suspended by Hostinger. They informed me that there was a script/virus on one of the sites. I don't know about it but i acknowledged the issue and asked them to either remove it or allow me to do so in order to have the sites unsuspended.

I registered my complaint on May 31st, and their support team kept telling me that the abuse team, which works in different time zones, would handle the unsuspension. However, five days later, all of my websites remained suspended, despite the issue being isolated to only one website. Their support team has been unhelpful, repeatedly sending the same generic responses.

As a result of their negligence, I have suffered significant losses. If they are unable to handle such issues properly, they should not have suspended the websites. I deeply regret choosing Hostinger. I was once a loyal customer and referred many of my clients to them, but now I am extremely dissatisfied with their service.","June 03, 2024",PK

Re-evaluate your fraud detection and traction policy. You lost me as a customer today. My account was some how flagged by your system. Without notification or warning the account was shutdown and the site was pulled. My email was taken offline. Only after I went through a bunch of prompts to stop me from speaking to an actual person to save your company money was I able to get a hold of someone who told me I needed to verify my credit card. Had I not reached out I would have never received notification that my account was shut down or that I had the ability to restore it. Once I did get instructions on how to restore it I needed to upload a picture of my credit card (not s good idea) and upload proof of payment. At this time I decided that if a company would take the rash decision to close my site down and lock me out without notice it was time to find another host. Unfortunately it has been painful trying to reclaim my domain name now. From a consumer point of view it seems like you have my url held hostage without reason other than commercial. Overall I would leave a zero star rating if I could. Even your feedback system is needlessly collecting info and asking me to agree to trust pilot selling my information in order to submit feedback that my experience with your company was awful.,"June 02, 2024",US

"I am experiencing significant issues with the CPU and RAM performance on Hostinger. Despite being provided with 12GB of RAM and 6 CPU cores, the server's performance, even with LiteSpeed and a cache plugin, is far from satisfactory.

My websites often load as if they are running on just 1GB of RAM. At times, the site is not even accessible, and when I check, both CPU and RAM usage spike without any apparent reason. This is particularly concerning given that my website content does not change often, yet the loading times are still slow.

This problem persists intermittently, making the service unreliable. I would appreciate an explanation and a solution to why these resources are not performing as promised.","June 02, 2024",TZ

"Hostinger repeatedly blocks our website due to a false copyright complaint. Despite paying approximately $1,000 per year for hosting services, our website is randomly blocked because of this erroneous claim. Multiple attempts to resolve this issue have only resulted in temporary unblocking, with no explanation or investigation provided. This level of service is unprofessional and unacceptable for the price range.

We sell an online subscription service, and due to this situation, our users have been unable to access the site for over 24 hours (multiple times) without any explanation. This has resulted in approximately $7,000 in damages, including credit card chargebacks, lost revenue, and canceled subscriptions.

We are moving all our accounts and websites from Hostinger, as they have shown no willingness to resolve the matter.

"Refused to refund for overcharging and correct fee for upcoming renewals

I have been with Hostinger from March 2022 on the Cloud Enterprise Plan which I signed up for $99.99 monthly. Some time last year, the company slashed prices to $64.99 on the same monthly plan except that reduction was not effected on my plan. When i queried, I was told it was a promotional offer. Today, 2024/05/29 the price is still the same for new sign ups. In fact, if you sign up today you get charged $64.99 and it renews at the same price meaning there is no promotion on the monthly package. I requested that my charge be matched with the current renewal price but they refuse. Instead, they offered me a 35% relief for the next renewal only but it would then come back to the hefty $99.99 they have been charging me. This is unfair to me as I am using the same service that new sign ups are using. Also, being a monthly deal, I should not be bound by the prices of 2 years ago when it was expensive. Would have loved to stay because their service in other areas wasn't bad but the refusal to address the overcharging by way of refund or future tokens is very unfair on my part. If they rectified the charges for all upcoming renewals it would have been fair, but no, they just can't admit they overcharged me.","May 29, 2024",ZA

"Nobody answers emails to customer service at all, it was hard enough to find it. Nor to the ""quality"" email address they provide here in replies, what a joke.
I then had to switch computer and browser to use their chat, after having to click through a ton of non relevant topics. No option for hosted websites in the help menu (to contact Cs) at all.
My websites were ALL down / error message, while the admin panel said always ""okay"" . In months I never received a notification about this.
There's a useless ai tool, telling me to contact customer service.
So when I managed to get someone in the chat and it took forever for him to get back to me with the info, it turned out out ALL my websites were shut down by hostinger, bec supposedly 1 had an installation of a free LMS on it, from years ago (if I understood correctly, it wasn't easy to understand and they called it ""CMS"").
No notification about any of this in time, let alone any offer to resolve the issue they have created.
I still don't know if my email had worked even, CS in chat wouldn't reply to half of the things I asked and each reply took a very long time, altogether hours.
All I know I have been losing business for 3 months without knowing about this.
Hostinger has 100 percent lost my trust.
So, support in the chat made everything available again, I spent the rest of the evening, after losing the day on this (because I followed steps in their useless troubleshooting website after I got no help earlier), finally posting a blog post and then social media for it - - only to have the same error again!
No reply via email. Invhat again endless waiting, all in all hours. CS lady copy pasting and being condescending, basically telling me I was a malicious scammer bec I had years! ago installed the open source LMS Chamilo. So, one day, hostinger decides that LMS is a threat to them and suspend all my websites without a notification. Last night, after the websites were back online, they were suspended again, because the first CS representative had not emptied the trash folder, he had simply moved the installation there.
Great working, your automated systems hostinger, your serbmvice has declined to the point of unacceptable and I will look for a different holster today. Your CS denied to tell me how to cancel.

A few months later I noticed that pages with a 500 error often began to appear, then it didn’t work at all for about half an hour, they said something was wrong with the servers. Even then I had the idea to refuse their services. Then I received letters about copyright infringement with a request to remove the content on the site page, although there cannot be any violation there, on the page there is only an image I made and a little text. The fact is that I don’t even know what kind of violation there might be and asked them about it, but there was no answer. They simply responded to someone’s complaint without even understanding it. Another site was blocked even without warning. Then another site was blocked without warning. In this regard, I had to urgently leave this terrible company. I ask the Hostinger company not to look for my account, I have already moved away from you. Thank you for your services. One good thing is that I paid for the service only for a year, but used it for half a year. And the price is at least twice as high even with all the discounts, compared to other companies. And one more thing, how they deceive people and write in their personal account that your site has worked poorly for the last 24 hours and please switch to a more expensive service, although in fact I just made a site and it didn’t even work for one hour, like this their marketing.
So, to summarize: the price for such a service is too high, the same failures in operation as on cheap hostings, they can ask you to delete content without explaining a specific reason, there is support, but they respond with standard replies, a few more little things, but I won’t bother with them anymore. I’ll just say that all those who want to order a service from hosting should think about it very carefully, I, in turn, do not recommend doing this.
