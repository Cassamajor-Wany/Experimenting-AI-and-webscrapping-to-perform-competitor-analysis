"I've been dealing with an ongoing email issue with BlueHost for nearly three days now. My emails have not been sending, and despite reaching out to their support team, I've been told to wait for 4 hours at a time. It's now approaching 72 hours, and the problem is still not resolved. The lack of effective support and communication has been extremely frustrating. I would not recommend BlueHost to anyone looking for reliable email services or customer support.","August 31, 2024",MA
"Decent customer service, unfortunatly not respecting the GDPR regarding our data. Pricy for what is offers and a few downtime that they could not directly admit were because of them. Could be solved after opening 3 tickets...","August 31, 2024",FR
"My website drops out almost daily sometime 5 minutes sometimes 20 minutes even a couple of hours.
They also 'provided valued customers with an extra free domain' that they then charge you for. They will not refund this even though they can see the domain has not been used and that the dispute was brought within 5 minutes of payment being taken.
They then close the help chat without warning whilst I was replying.","August 31, 2024",GB
"Worst customer service. They do not even provide an email address but expect you to chat with them, like friends. Horrible. They disabled my email address and didn't give me a refund or any suitable apology. Don't trust Ashwini or anyone else in the customer service department. For what do I pay?","August 31, 2024",AT
"Awful load speed due to terrible response time, sometimes I see a blank screen for over 10s as I wait for Bluehost to respond and pull in the website content. Took three long conversations to confirm customer support can’t fix the issue because the chat starts from scratch each time and there’s no record of your previous conversation in the live chat, and no follow up via email. Not possible to change the primary domain/website, another problem that customer support was unable to solve. Posting this review again as Bluehost offered to help, but I didn’t respond to their request in time.","August 24, 2024",GB
"I had been hosting with them for a couple of years, but finally, no more!

Things did run smoothly until I needed them to help me resolve problems with web and email hosting. Their support agents are INCREDIBLY slow, things that took me 3 minutes with another hosting provider to resolve took BlueHost agents a whole hour and a half, and then it wasn't even resolved!! Their agents are super slow with responding and supposedly need like 10 minutes to retrieve every single piece of information lol They ask for information that I have already given them during the same conversation, just two lines prior, and then they need forever to check that info. The support is such a pain in the ass, and agents are clueless for even the simplest issues. Talked to five different guys about the same issue, got four different answers that were completely incompatible, and worst of all, none of them worked.

The cherry on top of this useless support service is the exorbitant fees they charge. Don't even bother with BlueHost, not worth it at all.

EDIT: To lower the rating from 2 to 1: After I just confronted the agent for being absolutely clueless, they of course didn't want to be rated badly. So this one agent sent me the fake survey message at the end, as if I won't notice the few inconsistencies (real survey message is automated and always looks the same, in fake one, agent didn't/couldn't bold the text etc.). So the agent sent me fake survey message, I let them know that the message looks different than automated message and they denied it lol If the survey message were actually real, then agent wouldn't be able to respond to me anymore!! So they denied (actually proving my point) and then they disconnected instantly, somehow foregoing real survey at the end. Unbelievable how scammy BlueHost agents are. Big NOPE","August 30, 2024",SI

"On April 24, 2024, I was contacted by Bluehost stating I had malware on my website, and I needed additional security. That day I paid $467.67 for malware protection, SSL, and backup services for my website. From that point forward, my site began experiencing outages for weeks and months at a time. Then, on July 18, 2024, I was informed that I had to renew my hosting subscription for an additional $305.69, bringing my total website expenses to $773.39. Despite paying these fees, my website remained offline for over 3 ½ months. I contacted sales and together we contacted the support team multiple times, only to be repeatedly assured that my website would be restored. It would briefly come back online, only to go down again within 24 hours. Each time, I had to spend approximately 4 hours with tech support, each and every time, who consistently shifted the blame elsewhere. I canceled all services and was promised a full refund, as confirmed in an email I received. Now, I am being told that the refund is outside of the refund period, and your team is refusing to honor the agreement. This is completely unacceptable, and I expected an immediate resolution. But now they are saying it's outside the refund period, and no refund will be given.
I have an email stating I would receive at least the Malware and Hosting monies back. This is the LAST correspondence I have received. Summary... none of the products sold to me worked at all. and I lost business!","August 19, 2024",US
I've used this company for decades. They used to provide excellent customer service. Now it sucks. Like most other large tech companies in the US they outsourced support to foreign countries and the people just don't care. My website isn't working and I can't get anyone there to fix it. I've been on hold on the phone for hours today - haven't been able to talk to anyone. Tried the chat and have had three different people tell me they are going to fix it and it's still not working.

"I’ve had a very disappointing experience with Bluehost over the past five years. Their servers have frequently broken down, making it extremely challenging to develop and maintain a website. Support is a constant struggle, often requiring lengthy chats with representatives who seem more interested in upselling expensive plugins rather than genuinely resolving issues. Overall, their service has been far from satisfactory, and I would not recommend Bluehost to anyone based on my experience.","August 28, 2024",LK

"Today I had the most ridiculous interaction with call-in support. The interaction, it turns out, was probably unnecessary if I had been more patient and willing to wait.
I clicked on my taskbar icon for Bluehost (a 3x3 grid of blue squares) which usually takes me to my webmail login. Instead it brought me to my account login. I entered the information correctly, thinking I would then find the entry to my webmail. I clicked ""Login"" and the blue banner just faded in and out. After the 3rd try, I received ERROR 1501 or something of that sort, telling me I was banned from access.
Since I run a medical practice through this site, I called Customer Support to get functionality back. The person with whom I was connected told me effusively how happy she was to help me in an accented English from which I could interpret only one word out of every three. Most of the conversation comprised respelling my name - repeatedly - in NATO phonetic alphabet format. I was so exasperated that I said ""just the same as last time!"" During this meaningless back-and-forth, I became impatient and simply went back to my existing login link. Lo and behold, the usual instrument came up, allowing me to login to my webmail without difficulty. I am not sure what the Customer service rep did while she was making me respell my name and account name, but she did not divulge what had happened. Frankly, I think Bluehost was experiencing technical difficulties and the rep was making sure I was distracted while you fixed what was wrong. Really disappointing!","August 27, 2024",US

We've tried all kinds of things from trying to start a new account and inviting the other with no success to preparing to hire Blue Host to most the entire site to it's own Blue Host hosting account.

No one seems to know the right way to do this and once we've dealt with a support person...no further actions seem to go forward.

I've now purchased a Blue Host account that's just sitting there costing me money and doing nothing. My developer is getting frustrated that no one seems to know what's going on with his request...and now no one seems to even know where the original account lives.

Really disappointing service and extremely confusing and inconsistent. I would never purchase another hosting account for Blue Host again.","August 15, 2024",CA
Bluehost is a horrible organization. I turned off auto renew on all my products. I was still charged for a 3 year hosting package without consent. They told me I had to turn off hosting auto renew on a different menu hidden inside of the system. To stop auto renew I changed my payment method. They stole another payment method from an entire different product that I purchased with them. I called within minutes of the charge. They refused to refund me the entire charge and only took me down to 1 year renewal. They refused to move me to a month to month. The customer support refused to allow me to speak to a manager. The customer support then refused to initialize the refund until I said I was satisfied with the company and his service. WOW. I will never allow anyone I care about to work with this company.,"August 20, 2024",US

I have been waiting for my authorization key since then but no response. I even emailed the main hosting domain provider for help but they too didn't respond and a few moments after I emailed them, Blue host suddenly wanted to charge my account without authorization. The worst of all is that the chat box has stopped working so I can no longer speak to customer support for assistance. I hate that I have spent money on this site hoping I could grow through them.

"Unauthorized Charges and Unhelpful Support - Terrible Experience

I had a frustrating and disappointing experience with Bluehost. They wrongly charged my account for domain renewals and added Domain Privacy + Protection services without my consent. Despite not authorizing these charges, they were still added to my billing, which is completely unacceptable.

To make matters worse, when I tried to resolve the issue through their support chat, the representative (Shamanth) disconnected the chat without providing any assistance. The support was utterly useless and left me with no answers or solutions.

I’ve requested a refund for these unauthorized charges, but if I don’t receive one soon, I’ll have to escalate the issue by filing disputes with PayPal and my credit card company. The lack of transparency and poor customer service has made me seriously reconsider ever using Bluehost again. Save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere for reliable hosting services.","August 26, 2024",GB
"I consistently struggle with their support department when there is a problem with my hosting account. The technicians give you information that is just incorrect and basically bs. Then they try to get you off of the line, saying they escalated the case. You never hear back from them in the time they quote. I'm so frustrated with this company. My web clients depend on having a site up and running to conduct their business. I'm embarassed to repeat what I'm being told by the Bluehost team.","August 25, 2024",US
"They will add mysterious subscriptions to your account and start charging you for them annually. Of course, no one ever logs into their hosting provider, so time will pass by before you notice you've been getting charged fraudulently. I think their strategy is to hope you don't notice and they'll make some extra money off of you. Then when you try to get the charges refunded because you did not authorize them, they insist you signed up for this service, forcing you to go the dispute route with your credit card company.","August 25, 2024",US
"I have reached out to Bluehost multiple times after they cancelled my domain that was purchased as part of a hosting package. I asked for the domain to be maintained, and to cancel the hosting portion of my purchase (I found the Word Press plug in not very intuitive for me), but both were cancelled instead. I have been told my domain will become available within 60 days ... then 90 ... then 120 ... then in March 2025 ... and now, unknown. I understand mistakes happen, but I am confused as to why each customer service person gave me different information, and now it seems impossible to get my domain renewed. I 100% would not use Bluehost again nor recommend them to others.","August 24, 2024",US

We realised what had happened and for more than 5 days we are still negotiating with Bluehost so we can have access to the account, make payment and have our services renewed!!! They have failed all their service time delivery and you have absolutely no feedback until you have followed up again and again! It has been such a frustrating experience! Then I learnt there is no complaint procedure, so no one taking responsibility! IF ANYONE IS PICKING UP THIS FROM THE TEAM, COULD YOU PLEASE FOLLOW THROUGH AND HELP RESOLVE THIS SITUATION?

"Customer service is excruciatingly slow as agents must be handling multiple chats at once.

UPDATE: I did finally get resolution from a rep. It took four or five phone calls to get this situation resolved. I am happier now, but this should not have happened. I told each rep that what was happening with my email with significantly affecting my business. I was in tears by the end of the conversations, until I found a rep who knew what they were doing.

When I asked for help, they requested the backup I had downloaded, but when they restored it, the staging site wasn’t included. I ended up losing all the work I had done.

"I'm experiencing an ongoing issue with cPanel not updating my business emails to my Outlook account. This problem occurs intermittently. After consulting a technical expert, I was advised to contact my business email provider as the issue seems to stem from the DSN, which can be affected during web host updates.

This evening, I reached out to Bluehost customer service to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, during the first call, the representative went silent mid-conversation, leaving me hanging. This happened again on my second call, and it became clear that the responders lacked the technical expertise needed to address my problem.

On my third attempt, I specifically requested to speak with someone more knowledgeable. As expected, I had to repeat the entire issue each time I called, which was frustrating given the apparent time constraints the responders were under. The last representative I spoke with asked me to hold while she transferred my call. There was a brief moment of hold music, but then it went silent again, leaving me uncertain whether I should continue waiting or if the connection had been lost. After a few minutes, I decided to hang up, as previous calls had shown that silence meant the connection was likely lost.

Given the amount of money I pay for their services, I expected a much higher standard of customer support. It's disappointing to see a decline in the quality of their service, especially since they were much more customer-focused in the past.

Long story short, I bought the mail hosting and for three or four days tried to setup my account into their server. I was a nightmare dealing with Customer Service is awful and imprecise. I got fed up with chatting and decided to call. They tried to make me change my Domain host and after I was not Ok with their proposed solution I swithched to another supplier and within 2 hours everything was working with no change in domain hosting.

I was told I needed more storage so I needed to changed from shared network to a dedicated VPS so I bought the dedicated VPS. Then my site went down. I was told it was because I need more storage than the dedicated VPS they told me to buy to fix the problem so I needed the Enhanced VPS. So I bought that. The site stayed down. I called back and they said it was because I needed to buy the Premier VPS. At this point of being misinformed I gave up.,"August 10, 2024",US
"Don't love the tactics of giving you a low intro rate and then hiking up the price dramatically after you're pretty locked in with them. Also they make it very difficult to transfer anything out once you get it in, for example transferring a domain to an outside registrar is incredibly difficult because they put up numerous roadblocks.","August 13, 2024",US
"I am disappointed in Bluehost Support. I had an issue with my SSL and contacted them at least 6 times (through chat or by phone) before it was resolved. The first time, they simply sold me another product and that didn't fix the issue. Once it was resolved, it wasn't done correctly but I don't have the time to keep contacting them. I also had a different problem a few days after that and had to contact them at least twice to resolve that one. The second problem was also not fully addressed, and the customer rep did not explain more when I was asking about the next steps. I will be researching other options and possibly switching to a different service.","August 08, 2024",US

"I cannot believe the sheer audacity of HostMonster and Bluehost. These companies are absolute disasters. My hosting account has been a nonstop nightmare, with servers hacked on a weekly basis. It's like they're running a charity for hackers!

To add insult to injury, someone managed to access my panel and purchase a whopping 25 domains without my authorization. Despite having two-factor authentication set up, their security is about as effective as a paperclip. When I finally realized the mess, I contacted support and was met with a shocking level of incompetence.

It took them over a week to even acknowledge the problem, let alone start to fix it. When I demanded a concrete timeline, the support rep abruptly ended the chat. I tried to escalate the issue to a manager, but they seemed to have vanished into thin air.

HostMonster and Bluehost are a disgrace to the hosting industry. Their servers are a breeding ground for hackers, their security is a joke, and their customer support is non-existent. I strongly advise anyone considering these companies to run as fast as possible in the opposite direction. You've been warned!

TL;DR: HostMonster and Bluehost are terrible. Servers get hacked constantly, security is a joke, support is useless, and they stole my money. Avoid at all costs!","August 07, 2024",EG
"Disappointed with BlueHost more and more. I have been using them for about a decade and they keep doing things that dissapoint me.

Most recently they gave me free .online domains that I did not ask for and set them up to auto renew. The emails they send to notify you, and the design of their website are designed to make it difficult to see what's what so that you end up paying for things you don't want or need.

Aside from that, sometimes my website just stops working for no reason and I have to contact customer service. They decided the unlimited plan I have had forever is no longer unlimited, but aren't very clear on how much space is offered. Every time I log in they are constantly trying to push domain privacy protection on me and again, design the page so that users accidentally click ""BUY"".","August 12, 2024",US

"Hosting, User Interface and Experience wise this company could improve a little bit. On the administration side tho, this company is one of the worse I've dealt with. After being on the chat for over an hour in total trying to cancel my hosting plan which was renewed without any notice, they finally agreed upon a refund of nearly €200 and cancel the renewal. A few days after, another charge of the same amount was made for the same product. Contacting the support chat they tell me that the refund has already been issued and a new charge hasn't been made. This is because their backend doesn't show charges made straightaway. So here I am again, spending more than an hour of my time and spending money for something that they didn't fix. Most of their custom agents is also not smart enough to comprehend these things and they just work with pre-installed chat buttons.","August 11, 2024",NL

"A domain was sitting on Hostgator and our client wanted off of it. Hostgator is another awful hosting company. They made the mistake of choosing Bluehost, without asking for our recommendation. They moved it off Hostgator but it never really moved to Bluehost. However, Bluehost's incompetent agents, reading off scripts and wasting our time with platitudes, couldn't realize what was wrong and after DAYS of chatting with different agents, and escalating it to advanced support, they figured out the issue. A bigger problem was that we couldn't see what was wrong because their Cpanel was not working and was repeatedly showing a missing 404 page. In the near week that I dealt with them, they still had not fixed their own backend. They keep spewing malarkey that the issue is just propagation and we have to be patient to wait the 48 HOURS and the problem would fix itself. After a wasted two days that our client's site is DOWN, the site is still not working and they investigate again and find another issue and promise that it will be fixed after another 48 HOURS of propagation. Of course it wasn't and our client is freaking out by now. We had to do all the investigation and figure out what was going on. The representatives are useless, incompetent and clearly, poorly trained. Any website that needs to be up at all times should stay FAR AWAY from this company. They offer nothing and at higher than normal pricing. They try to lure you in with first year discounted pricing but then you pay more than better hosting companies after the first year. Other domain registrars and hosting companies, the needed changes would have been done successfully within 20 minutes by us and within a few minutes by their competent support reps. Propagation would never take days, but merely minutes or a few hours. I just need to make sure that it is known by all that this is an awful, incompetent hosting company.

In a panic, I spent hours/days talking to support and getting escalated to the moon without anyone knowing how or why it happened. I'm not new to websites or hosting, so I was baffled by this and the complete lack of knowledge and support by their ""support team"", especially when Bluehost is supposedly one of the top 2 hosts. They told me I had to start over and I did. With another host. Never again.","July 17, 2024",US
"My whole website was taken down with no way to retrieve it. Why?
They sent a renewal notice for my hosting, but under the name of a no-longer-registered subdomain that hasn't been used in many years. So naturally I said I didn't want to renew it. But the renewal wasn't for the subdomain, it was for the primary domain.
Why didn't they use my customer ID or primary domain in the renewal notice? Who knows! But I lost everything with no way to retrieve it.
That's about as bad as it gets.
UPDATE Aug 17:
Bluehost read my review and contacted me directly.
After originally being told by their online support that my site was lost and nothing could be done, the escalation team helped me set up a new hosting account, and retrieved my files so that I could restore them.
I'm happy that they could do this, and lucky my hosting account is no longer mission-critical as it used to be, otherwise my business would have suffered significantly.
Unfortunately there was no reasonable explanation as to why this whole situation occurred and no undertaking to update their renewal processes, so sadly no guarantee it won't happen to anyone else.

"Singularly the most dishonest interaction with a business I have EVER had.

Kept getting told different pricing, all of which was more expensive than what's advertised on their website. They have lots of tricks to dupe their customers.

"8/15/2024: So in addition to being fraudsters and thieves, in turns out they are also liars.
I filed a dispute with my credit card company on 8/6/24. On 8/7 I got a call from Cassie A from Bluehost's parent company, Newfold Digital wanting to resolve the dispute. Great!, I thought. After a 15 minute discussion, she agreed to givfe us a total refund. Great again!
A week later I noticed the refund had not yet posted and my credit card dispute was still in a pending status so I called to find out why. It turns out, they actually rebutted our claim to the credit card company.
Absolutely told me one thing over the phone and told the credit card company the very opposite thing.

8/2/2024. 12:43P CST Beware This Company.
Bluehost just took $2160 of my money for services they never provided and are refusing to refund it.
I just got off the phone with Jeph B who, (according to him) is the very highest person on the ladder at the BH Professional Services Design Team, and so whatever complaint I have stops with him. There is, according to him, nobody at BH I can escalate my case to.
As briefly as I can: I signed up with BH to design and build a small e-commerce website for me and unfortunately, paid up front. During the sign-up process, I was told, (apparently by William) that I would be contacted by phone to start the ""intake"" process so that they could do an initial design. I told this [William] that I had digital content (incl. product photos, product descriptions, etc) and that I would be more comfortable submitting my content electronically or on a web form and I was assured I would be able to do that.
I was eventually contacted by Mark who wanted to do the intake by phone; but after a time, realizing it was going to be too time consuming and difficult to convey over the phone, I told him I would much rather submit my information electronically and asked for a form or link. Mark said I could do that and sent me a link to the form.
The link took me to a website Change Request form. I assumed that was the form he wanted me to use. So I filled it out and added our logo and three products to start the design with. Mark contacted me later and said they never got the info. When I told what form I filled out, he said that (the form he directed me to) was the wrong form and urged me to continue telephonically. Well, I don't actually have a couple of free hours to talk on the phone to explain my website, but I tried. 45 minutes in, he asked about our logo which offered to send him; he apparently contacted a supervisor and came back to tell me he did not know how I could submit my content.
Mind you, this is a professional IT web design team and they apparently have no idea how to exchange data electronically. Why would they insist on exchanging graphic design information over the phone rather than electronically?
I finally lost confidence in their abilities to do the job I hired them for and called in to cancel my order and asked for a refund. I spoke to Clark, (I believe) for over 40 minutes explaining that I wanted to cancel and why. I did not record the conversation and I can't quote him verbatim, but I left the conversation with the distinct impression that my refund would be processed within several business days.
Days later, I received a voicemail and an email from Jeph saying he was responding to a request for a ""supervisor call-back."" I was confused by that but was able to take his call shortly after.
I explained the request for refund issue to Jeph and he was very sympathetic and he informed me that the refund policy had to be exercised within 3 days of purchase and my request came in on the fourth day. BUT, he said he was going to argue my case for a refund since we never got anything done.
Later, Jeph called back and said the person I really needed to talk to was William and that he would contact me within 72 hours.
William never called. So I called the team back and was able to speak to Jeph. He explained to me that the final decision on my refund was to deny it because I didn't make the request withing 3 days. I told him that was unacceptable and that I wanted to escalate this issue and asked for a contact.
This time Jeph informed me that there was no one higher than him. I recapped for him his promises to advocate on my behalf, to make my case and to fight for me and asked him, if he was top of the food chain, who was he making my case to?
Well it appears that he and the illusive William are the co-chiefs of the design team. When I asked explicitly who, he told me nobody at BH can override their co-decision. Well in my 64 years, I've never seen an business unit, even a subcontractor) under a large umbrella like BH that does not have a higher authority, so this story is not yet over. I will update at a later time.","August 01, 2024",US

It literally says FREE on the order but they actually charge $12.99, which is insane when you can get $1 domains from other companies!

And here’s the kicker: if you sign up for BH and import your own domain, they charge the SAME price for hosting. So essentially they’re charging for domains but advertising them as free AND they’re showing inaccurate prices on the receipt. That’s false advertisement!","August 02, 2024",US

"I am extremely disappointed with Bluehost. If I could give them zero stars I would. I’ve been with them for 11 years and initially chose them because of their great reputation and promises of excellent service. Recently, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.
They were not truthful about their service capabilities and gave me false information. Their customer service is appalling. I initially wanted to downgrade the service because I don’t host many websites and the renewal cost was very high. The tech said that was no problem and that they would migrate the sites for $149. I told her to go ahead and put me on the other hosting plan. To my dismay, her information was incorrect in that it was $149 per site! I didn’t want to pay that and to please point the sites back to the original hosting and I would migrate the sites myself. Being inexperienced, I had not backed up the sites recently before I had Bluehost change the hosting plan. I know it was ignorant on my part, but I thought Bluehost had the sites backed up like they used to. Now you have to pay for that service.
On several occasions, the issues were escalated and they completely ignored my issues or gave me vague, inaccurate, and irrelevant answers. It felt like they didn’t care about resolving my problems.
Additionally, their technical support team seemed inexperienced. Instead of fixing the issues, they often made things worse by messing with the files and databases, causing more downtime and disruptions! My websites have been left in a mess, and I’m still trying to get things back to normal.
Overall, Bluehost has proven to be unreliable and unprofessional. Their false advertising and poor service have cost me time, money, and a lot of stress. I would not recommend them to anyone looking for a dependable hosting provider.","June 30, 2024",US

There support is some of the worst ever. Their chat doesnt work correctly and it doesnt notify you that they have responded so you dont respond... but then the chat closes because you didnt respond in like a minute.

If you get passed that their answer is always to contact the plugin company. So you do that and the plugin company tells you to contact bluehost. Then, bluehost makes a change and the issue is temporarily resolved but never permanently... and they dont tell you what they changed.

They are always pushing you to upgrade as well... Almost like the entire goal of their support team is to make sales. Im also suspicious that they do less so that you have more problems and finally give in to upgrading and thinking that its the only thing to solve your problems.

If you are a business owner online and do not want to deal with Website issues EVERY SINGLE WEEK of your business then DO NOT get bluehost.

My most recent experience with their support had them send me a url that described a known issue. There were 3 possible fixes to the issue. I had already tried one, the other one was diving through all my code and the 3rd was to see if my hosting provider has any limits set that could be causing the issue. When I asked them to help with that solution they said it was ""out of their scope""

My website problem momentarily crashes once a month due to the server issues. They have almost yearly scheduled maintenance and they say there will be no impact but there always is.

One time their support even directed me to delete a staging site and it actually deleted my production site in the process. Took a week to resolved and restore backups.

"Worst Hosting Company Ever! Had me pay for two different plans at the same time thanks to their deceptive advertising practices. And then when one of these plans that ran out, which happened to be the one my website was on, they refused to give me access to my website data. Even though they had $155.40 on my account because their lazy crooked people on chat told me I needed this to run woo commerce which is FREE! i ended up disputing through Paypal and won! Stil lost my website thanks to this company. Moved over to another host and have no problems at all.","July 24, 2024",US
"I wish I could give 0 stars to Bluehost and that I could add screenshots as a prove of how bad their customer service is. An agent called ""Pratheek"" (there were many other but this was the last one) kept on going on circles asking the same question and solving nothing in the end.
I was asked by sitelock to request bluehost to ""whitelist"" certain IP addresses and I immediately did it and the agent who helped at that time said (as usual) ""It has been done"", and guess what? 4 days later turns out they hadn't done it? Surprisingly? Of course not, this is the beautiful customer service Bluehost offers.

Then I came back to bluehost again! asking for help. The first agent, useless he couldn't do a thing, kept me waiting for more than 20 minutes to later just close the chat on their own.

Then Pratheek, a new agent, I asked him to just ""whitelist"" the IPs and gues what? again I waited for ages as he told me ""I am on it"" ... 10 minutes lates he sent me a link? what? what for? he said for me to do it from my end ... really? you took 10 minutes just to send me a link? If I could do it on my own why would I contact you in the first place. Second, it you ""experts"" couldn't do that task properly the first, second, third time, how possibly a simple user could do it?

Finally, the agent, after nearly 30 minutes of interaction, went ahead and did what I asked to please do from second 1 ...whitelist the ""IP addresses"".

God knows if they did it properly this time. When it comes to bluehost, one can expect nothing less than bad customer service, long waiting times, and inefficient and unskilled agents.

I needed to ask for ""proof"" that it had been done coz honestly I trust 0 Bluehost agents. And of course, any proof could be given.

Hopeless, that is how I feel in every interaction.","July 24, 2024",PE

"About 4 months ago I switched from greengeeks to bluehost for my web hosting. Yes I saved almost 40% but I now profoundly regret it. I made a mistake and it resulted in me not having access to my email used to verify my login. I have my primary email, I have phone registered with them, I have my username and password. I have the one time security code necessary to recover the account. But because no one at bluehost cares I can't access my account. 4 chat sessions of about 15 minutes each, a phone call, uploads of id cards, utility bills, checking statements , and over FIVE DAYS and these a**holes still wont let me login. The last chat and email both assured me this process that is supposed to take 24-48 hours would be completed within a couple of hours ( 118 hours so far) and what comes in my email A REQUEST THAT I START THE ENTIRE REQUEST PROCESS OVER! Apparently there is a lot of people with 0 authority handeling contacts and no one with authority dealing with customers. One of my email accounts is full and bouncing customers but these people will not help. The lack of professionalism is astounding. Yes there prices are less than competitors but there is s reason. I've had a website for over 20 years, I've had the host company bought and movec overseas, ...have used at least 7 companies. The service here is tha worst. I feel no concern for my issues.They don't want to help they want the easiest way to make me go away.

"Absolutely awful service so far. I switched from SiteGround because BlueHost had some really cheap offers, and I've only had an account for a couple days, and after 1 day, the website is not accessible! I can't login to the wordpress admin! I had to contact the chat support, and they seemed to have no idea what they were doing. Took forever to connect, then were very slow. More frustrating, the first support agent said it was some server problem - but wasn't specific about what was wrong - and that it was nothing to worry about, it would be fixed in a couple hours. Then 4 hours later, it still wasn't fixed! This is a HUGE problem for anyone hosting a website, you can't be down for hours at a time, absolutely ridiculous! Why am I even paying you???

On top of that, the 2nd customer service agent finally told me that my IP address was wrong. Okay, how did it get messed up? Why was it fine the first day and not the second day? What happened?!

Then, she told me it could take 0 to 8 hours to update. Fine, technology can take time...but this is really awful way to start a new webhosting service. Especially after already waiting 4 hours...if it happens again, I will be demanding a refund.

Update: After more than 24 hours, the website is still down! The ""support"" actually seem to have no idea what they're doing. I'm assuming they were the cheapest ""support"" team they could find in India. Cutting costs as much as possible? Maybe, the horrid support makes it seem like that's the case!","July 18, 2024",NZ
"I have a list of everything that went wrong in the last 3 weeks because Bluehost is just terrible at everything:
1. Customer service: the worst I have ever experienced. They take ages to respond and even close the chats without consideration, with the issue being unsolved.
2. Every agent gives you different information. I think there have been no less than 20 interactions over the last 3 weeks coz we were desperately looking for help and trying to solve the issue just to face different ""solutions"" given by the agents, which none seemed to work.
3. Cyberattacks: They, until now, haven't done anything regarding cybersecurity (other than of course buying an expensive site lock tool which we were pretty much forced to do as we did not have another alternative) which makes your website exposed and vulnerable to any cyberattack like we had been for a month.
4. Bought sitelock from Bluehost, when purchasing it I followed an agent's instructions together with a link they sent (my website was an add-on, not the main one) and I made sure I chose the correct website and guess what? My purchase went to the wrong website!!!! When I went back to asked what happened and that I needed the tool on my site as it was down already coz of malware, a very unskilled agent said that wasn't possible and that ""I made the mistake"". How was my mistake when I had someone from your team guiding and I did choose my website! Then the agent disrespectfully just closed the chat without any solution. I was shocked by their lack of professionalism. Even when I asked, to simply transferred the tool to my site, the agent again said no is not possible. Later on, on a different chat, we were asked if ""we would like the sitelock to be transferred"" (what the heck? didn't the other agent just said it wasn't possible?).
5. I went back 2 or 3 times about the same issue coz every time it seemed like the ""previous agent"" didn't do what was supposed to do. It was a matter of luck until one skilled agent would be helpful (again, that would take no least than 3 attempts). Why don't you train the agents properly? Their lack of knowledge it's outrageous (at times even I had to tell them what to do from their end coz they simply didn't know what to do)
6. It's nuts, I've had sooooooo many issues with Bluehost coz their lack of empathy, lack of ethics, lack of knowledge from your agent and moreover the lack of consideration for their customers who trust something so important for our business.

It's just really tiring to deal with you guys, I have never encountered a worse company than yours (among all companies, regardless of the type).

And guess what? there is no way you can complain about any of these things.

Would face issues regularly, where their servers go down or I won't be able to access my hosting dashboard or the servers would be so slow.

Upon reviewing my account, I found no products nearing renewal, and I did not authorize any automatic payments for my products. Furthermore, I did not receive any payment acknowledgement or invoice for this transaction, which raises my concern about the legitimacy of this charge.

Additionally, I find it very concerning and frustrating that there appears to be no escalation option available beyond the initial level of support. Most of the time, the initial level of support tends to either close the chat from their end or provide false information, making it difficult to address such serious issues effectively and promptly.","July 17, 2024",IN

I purposely kept everything off AUTORENEW - yet somehow a product (we didn't want) autorenewed. I got a blip on my card at midnight of the charge, and called them first thin gin the morning. Their non-US based called center said ""sorry, all renewals are 100% nonrefundable, even if our website f'd up"". Onlin chat, no help. FB chat, no help. So I did a charge back. Capital One was very helpful, however BlueHost responded with their aweful horrible legalese they are not liable and lost the charge back.

BlueHost then suspended my account. I can't do anything with it.

""Customer Service"" is a joke. its merely people responding to comments/questions. They don't help you! They just try to sell you more things. There is NEVER, EVER a billing resolution with Blue Host, aka HostMonster.

The case is still open. You will have to wait for the team to reach out to you. They will reach out to you soon.
I don't even know what's that supposed to mean? My question is not is the case open or closed. I need this resolved now.

It seems the updated prices are decent but their service and support has been so painstaking to deal with had to contact support any time I wanted to know what my renewal prices would be, even paid for fully managed hosting with SSL provided and they let my sites DNS records go offline for around 2 months then blamed me but if I wanted to manage the SSL and hosting why am I paying them 175$/yr to host my website for me if they are just waiting for me to ask for help?

Don't fall for the nice interface and all the free bells and whistles that they throw at you free for a year or at a discount trust me it was around 70$ for the first year next they tell me its 225$ a year or I can do a 2 year renewal instead and get all of my services for only 348... I even filed for a data request of my customer support and account logs and was never responded to, was even sent a promo email from the DNS verified ""e.bluehost.com"" email they use for their marketing emails and keep saying its a scam, they just have no idea what the left or right hand is doing... Its a headache if I realized all of the shady business practices and lengthy terms I would have never signed up.

Carl told me he could offer 15% then he said his max discount was 20%. I asked if he was in Retention and he said no, that he and John were at the same level but he could offer more because he had worked at Bluehost for 5 years. He then went on to say “let me look up John to see how long he has been with Bluehost.” Since their length of employment was irrelevant to my situation, I said, “I really don’t think that matters,” and asked him to connect me to Retention.

He started telling me I should hang up and call back because he felt like I was ‘calling him a liar and he did not like people who called him a liar.’

I did nothing remotely of the sort. He kept going on and on that if I didn’t trust him I should hang up.

"I've mostly had good experiences with BlueHost up till this last week.

The blue host server messed up several of my websites, and judging from their recent reviews, it feels like something has happened internally in the last couple of weeks that has caused customer support to turn on their customers pretty flagrantly.

I discovered blue host installed something called Wonder Blocks on websites that blocks access to the theme's editor for two of my sites, and BH says it is the theme's fault. It seems that the product was named appropriately.

They have screwed up my upload folder on a site when fixing a media file issue that was caused because of their server. And in fixing that totally wiped out the CSS. Fortunately, I had backups.

In dealing with customer support today, tech Joe was quite rude; he said the issue was that the domain was not pointing to blue host. I was able to prove that was not true, but it's just not worth going back to them anymore.

I also noticed that if you have a not-so-good experience with a tech, he will put you on hold and not forward you to the survey in order to keep from getting the low ratings they deserve for lack of politeness and or knowledge.

The shame of it is I have recommended bluehost to many clients, so now I will be recommending they all move.

All that work that went into getting the website just right went out the window since the website's coding had been corrupted. When I asked about that, they wanted to charge me additional money. I asked that my website be restored to the March or April timeframe when it was last completed to my satisfaction, and according to their tech (Julie), they could not do it.

We just kept getting blagged and nonsense mischievous interference. So this morning we literally had to pay a fee to the UK Based firm Nominet to do the transfer for us. Our new hosting company were quite clear this was Bluehost who were blocking the IPS tag change, so we literally had to pay money elsewhere to get our company domain back this morning!. Think long and hard about using Bluehost for your company. They will no doubt respond referring to their 'Escalation emails' blagging, nonsense emails etc etc, and the usual blagging excuses, but in 20 years of managing domain names I've never had such a disgusting, mischievous and stressful experience with a Host company, and its the first time our company website has mysteriously gone offline under their watch with their interferences! We literally only paid for the year's hosting fee a couple of months back, but in all honesty it was probably a worthwhile hit to ensure we have a continual online presence and operational emails for our company.

When I initially contacted support they said there was nothing they could do. They said that renewals are charged at this triple rate so I am effectively being penalised for being a loyal customer. It took over 30 mins on chat to get them to reduce the price but it is still double what I paid the past 2 years, for exactly the same service.

"What has happened at Bluehost? We are not just talking heavy sales pitch. This feels at least like sharp practice and borders on dishonesty. I got several emails urging me to auto renew for various products. The big ticket one was for my 3 year Wordpress Plus Hosting, due to expire mid July. They had changed my plan to something called Wordpress Choice Plus. Noone contacted me about doing that and certainly never gave my permission. We had a 3 year contract. How can they just change it? I got an email telling me to renew Choice Plus immediately in June. And to swich on autorenew. At a price of $719 - more than 3 times what I paid for WP Plus hosting. During the first very long, slow chat, I told them I wanted to stay on my current plan - the one I paid for. Unbeknown to me, they then suspended my website!
Last week, I discovered that my website was down. I spent most of the day on chats with various personnel at Bluehost. Finally, someone agreed to make my website active again. I noticed that SSL and Sitelock seemed to be switched off but she assured me that they would be reset within a few hours. I just checked again now and they are still switched off. And my plan is showing as Wordpress Choice Plus! When I looked at the small print, I noticed that new option has a lot of items removed or they are only included in the price for the first year of a 3 year plan.
And I only just saw that this new plan excludes SSL and Sitelock which had been included in my previous bundle, each now an additional $3.33 per month so the final bill would be nearly $1,000. That also means that my website has been put at risk and is still at risk.
I learned to ignore all the pushes to buy ""privacy protection"" - my contact details are on every page of my website. Final straw. They also sent a batch of warning emails that my domain registration was about to expire and I should turn on auto renew. This was not true. My domain is good for another 15 months. They were trying to get me to ""renew"" a "".online "" domain name similar to mine. A domain that I never bought and never used.

I migrated from the shared hosting service to VPS as an upgrade because I was promised that this should have improved my site speed:
- Migration was managed in a horible way. No communication, lack of clarity and redundant requests to share already provided info
- After the migration I had a dozen of problems, for which I had to reach out to the support team and waste many hours
- Some agents simply close the chat after reading your case description
- The rest just care about convincing you that it is a domain name propagation issue promising that the issue will be solved in 24 hours after domains propagate. Then in the next 24 hours ther would be another similar execuse or some other totally random opinion that they act on
- Sometimes they cause more problems such my website not loading at all due to some server processes faliure
- It have been weeks now that I have a slower website, and emails on my domain name completely out of service

"I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Bluehost's customer support. Here’s a detailed account of what happened:

I purchased a hosting plan and domain from Bluehost, and the transaction was initially successful. I was even able to set up my base website. However, after one day, I received an email stating that my order was canceled due to an issue with my credit card, and a refund was processed. The problem is, I used a virtual ghost card for the transaction, which was deleted after the purchase, meaning I couldn't access the refunded amount.

When I reached out to Bluehost support to resolve this, the response I received was unsatisfactory and frustrating:

1. Support Agent Avin’s Response: The agent, Avin, acknowledged that the refund was issued to the deleted virtual card and couldn't be reverted. They claimed that refunds are automated and couldn't offer a solution to redirect the refund to another card or reinstate my order.

2. No Resolution or Compensation: When I asked if there were any plans or compensations to resolve the issue, Avin merely offered to reduce renewal prices for future hosting plans, which doesn't help since I lost both the service and my money.

3. Unfair Treatment: I pointed out that if Bluehost doesn't support virtual cards, they shouldn't accept them in the first place. This oversight on their part has left me without the service I paid for and no way to access my refunded money.

I provided all necessary details and even the transaction receipt, but the support I received was inadequate. The agent’s inability to offer a tangible solution or proper compensation is unacceptable. As a result, I have decided that this will be my first and last time using Bluehost, and I cannot recommend their services to anyone.

This entire experience has been extremely frustrating and has left me feeling unsupported and unheard. I hope others can learn from my experience and proceed with caution when considering Bluehost for their hosting needs.","July 03, 2024",DE

And then don't even get me started about trying to get clarification out of them as I was desperately trying to get a straight answer as to which services I was paying for.

2. I paid for a domain renewal on 9 May 2024. and now Bluehost have been unable to provide me with a receipt for payment. I require the receipt for my Tax return. Between 9 May and 26 Jun I have phoned Bluehost 7 times and emailed 5 times. Every time I contact them they say they will look into the issue - but nothing is getting resolved. Every time you email you get a responses from a different person with each saying we will look into my case.
There is no direct method to reach the ""Escalated Support Team"" all you can do is email. I have requested that a supervisor from escalated support call me - guess what - no phone call

3. This is the list of 5 different people who have all emailed me saying they will ""look into my issue"":

Shubhashree J Escalated Support team
Sandesh P. from the Escalated Support Team
Disha D. from the Escalated Support team
Abhishek, U. from Escalated Support team
Lavanya S Escalated Support team

4. How hard can it be to write an invoice for the payment that you received nearly 2 months ago?

5. Here is my support ref number just in case the person who replies to reviews is looking S-2567414

6. If I could give you minus stars I would.

7. If you are running a business I would advise not giving your money to this company who appears not to care about their customers.

Update to my review:
8. 43 days and no receipt received

As NewFold Digital are the owners of BlueHost is it possible for me to make an official complaint about the BlueHost Escalation Team with you ?

"I became a Bluehost customer because a third party web building company misled me with a ""free website"" offer. The company implied they would build the website for me. They didn't. I was required to host with Bluehost as part of the deal. After a year of not having a site, I asked Bluehost if they would credit me for one year. I told them I would continue with them and get someone legit to build my site. Bluehost refused so hasta la vista.","June 02, 2024",US
"I have used Bluehost for several months now. I paid for an email address with my domain name. It worked for a few weeks and randomly disappeared from my account one day. In lieu of talking to customer service, I bought another email address. It has never worked. I've tried resetting the password from the admin page multiple times. It doesn't matter. I keep getting the same error messages. I've talked to customer service. They supposedly escalated the request because the support person I was on the phone with for quite some time couldn't fix it and had no idea what was wrong. I got an email from the escalated support person telling me to do everything I'd already done. I responded back that it didn't work. They never responded to my email. If the issue is not resolved this week, I am going to have to go to another domain. I do not recommend Bluehost because you do not get what you pay for and the support is useless. My website has also had some random glitches. For example, I've gone on there and all of my pictures are missing from the website. I'll go back a couple of days later, and they will return.","June 23, 2024",US
"Your Customer Support people Are TOP NOTCH. However, it is the WRONG-HEADED CHOICE from the President/CEO (Ultimately, this is the person who is responsible for making this decision) that I, nor any of Bluehost's customers, no longer have the ability to go into our accounts and look-up which domains have been charged for renewal, when it was done and how much it was for. I have called in several times just hoping that the previous customer support person was new and didn't know, but it was CONFIRMED TO ME after a couple of attempts, that I cannot do that. Each time I called, I was on the phone for at least 30+ minutes, and probably much longer because your Customer Support ARE GOOD PEOPLE and are trying to find the ability, the solution for me to go into my account and look up this info by probably contacting elder colleagues and eventually managers. Instead, I was told that I have to hold on to each renewal email that was sent to me (hopefully none of those emails hit my SPAM Folder) and refer back to them if I want to know that info so that I can appropriately label which domain and other expenses to designate to specific expense accounts. What kind of service provider would do that to their customers? Reduced service capabilities within our account, yet charge us more?
ALSO, I have noted that Bluehost has been increasing their domain renewals every year over the past several years...it seems...and it is wearing me out...and it is incentivizing me to consider moving to another reasonably priced service provider. I'm not looking for ""cheap"" because you get ""cheap"" service, but a rate that is more reasonable and lines up with the service that I get and expect from a service provider. I don't have a specific ""Date of Experience"", but this experience happened within the past 12 months when you ""updated"" your system and has really been nagging at me for a long time about this. I'm not going to list one of my domains with you, out of concern for retribution. If I'm wrong about not being able to go into my account and look at the renewal details that I had been getting before this ""UPDATE"", then you need to re-train ALL of your customer support personnel and send an email to ALL of your customers the instructions on how to EXACTLY go into our accounts and find these renewal details that we've had access to for years...
I have been a Bluehost customer for many years, about 15-20 years...you are the company that I got started with and have been with all of these years. I hope this review will help initiate change for management to re-look at account capabilities and even consider friendlier price point changes on renewals for domain names.
This has truly been and still is, a genuine experience. I have no ill-will towards Bluehost, nor have I been paid to give this review, it is under my own volition.","September 05, 2023",US
"Terrible service and help. Got passed around, no clear answer, and tried for escalation but never happened. I kept getting passed to level one tech support but definitely needed more support.

Your representative explained that I hadn't replied verbally or via email refusing this option, therefore, is was added. I find this annoying and unethical. Since I hadn't called within 30 days, no money would be refunded. I hadn't received my credit card bill until after that time frame. I want a refund! Sara Brinkmann","May 14, 2024",US
"I regret to say that my experience with Bluehost has been extremely disappointing. Recently, my website was hacked, and despite my best efforts, I could not recover it. This has been a frustrating and disheartening ordeal.

Security Issues:
One of the primary reasons I chose Bluehost was for their supposed reliable security features. However, my website was hacked, causing significant data loss and disruption. It appears that the security measures in place were inadequate to prevent this breach.

Lack of Support:
When I reached out to Bluehost support for help, the response was far from satisfactory. The support team was slow to respond, and when they did, their solutions were generic and unhelpful. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to get any meaningful assistance in recovering my site.

Data Recovery:
The most frustrating part of this experience was the inability to recover my website. Bluehost's backup services, which I assumed would be a safety net, proved to be unreliable. I found myself in a situation where all my content, design, and hard work were lost.

Rebuilding My Website:
Now, I am left with no choice but to rebuild my website from scratch. This is not only time-consuming but also mentally exhausting. The ordeal has significantly disrupted my business operations and caused me to lose trust in Bluehost as a hosting provider.

In conclusion, my experience with Bluehost has been nothing short of disappointing. The security vulnerabilities, lack of effective support, and unreliable backup services have all contributed to a highly negative experience. I would not recommend Bluehost to anyone looking for a dependable hosting provider. There are other options out there that prioritize customer security and support much better than Bluehost.","June 25, 2024",GB
i am so puzzled by this experience. i was not able to log into my account and ask for the representative to help me retrive my code or resend it to me. i've worked plenty in customer support so it shouldn't be a problem. but the rep kept asking odd questions and ask me to give HER the verification code which i don't have and for that reason exactly i contacted the support from the begin with,"June 25, 2024",IL

"dismal service, nickle and dime you at the worst moment possible. enjoy the $150 because you lost $20,000 of yearly business across multiple accounts I manage. All other hosts will help you restore your site if anything happens, these guys charge you $150 for it. At the very least empower your managers to help your customers at least with a one time pass.

Onto migrating all my clients now. if you are new and looking for a trustworthy host stay clear of bluehost","June 20, 2024",US
"I recently encountered significant challenges with Bluehost regarding my website's migration and billing. After my subscription renewed, I contacted them for a domain migration, quoted at $100 for the domain and $150 for migration. I agreed and paid $250 total. Unexpectedly, I was also charged an additional $515 to restore my site to its original e-commerce functionality.

Upon addressing this mischarge, Bluehost admitted the error, agreeing to reinstate my site for 30 days and refund the $150 migration fee. They also assured me that they would refund the $515. After a few days, I received $350 and $150 as refunds. However, this was short of the full $515 by $165. When I followed up, they explained that some services in the $515 were non-refundable.

Feeling frustrated and misled, I was advised by a Bluehost representative to report the issue as fraud to my bank and was promised a follow-up by a manager, which never happened. After a week of no contact, I had to initiate the call myself. They still refused to process the remaining $165 refund, insisting they had resolved the issue by refunding $350.

This situation has placed a significant strain on my business, both financially and emotionally. Despite my patience and numerous discussions with customer service, I am left disappointed by Bluehost's handling of the matter and their lack of accountability.","June 21, 2024",US

"This email hosting service took down our website, crashed our computer system, corrupted our whole email account, and our in house IT department could not even fix the damage.

But I would not use this company ever again. Sorry for the bad review bluehost. But you just cost us a ton of money and headaches. So you deserve the bad review. This hurt us very bad.


UPDATE 6-28-2024. Their reply is a lie. They only redunded 60% of the money, and kept about 40% of the money. We cancelled within 3 days after the DNS SERVER code was changed. They refused to do a refund no matter how many times we pleaded with them, hence the angry review you are reading. We lost 10 years worth of documents and were never able to get them back. Very shady company, obvious liars. Run away from this company!!! You will run the risk of having your website, and email crash. Then when you cancel. You will not get all your money back.

"I have used Bluehost for over 18 years. I have used them to host several business and personal websites. They used to be a great company with great customer service, but not anymore. In the past year, I have had nothing but problems with their support. One of my websites was built with Weebly which they stopped offering. So I switched to WordPress. The switch was a nightmare and the automated installer did not delete or rename any of my old Weebly files which rendered my site inaccessible. I spent 6 hours between chatting online or live with their support, and all I got was that it was not their problem because they are ""server admins"" and cannot and will not help me figure out what went wrong. I escalated my request to their higher support who were just as dismissive and unhelpful. This is not a way to treat customers especially when the issue took place using their installer.

There are a lot of great hosting providers out there. Bluehost is NO longer one of them. I plan to migrate my sites elsewhere. Shame on Bluehost for abandoning one of their loyal customers.","June 15, 2024",US

When I inquired how it could go up so much, I was told that the first 3 years were discounted and I was now required to pay the full price.

"I used Bluehost exclusively for all client site hosting before 2016, when I retired. So, when I was asked to do some pro bono design in 2022, I immediately chose Bluehost hosting services.

Boy has it changed. They get you in the door with an incredible hosting price but nickel-and-dime you for additional services and service is not what it used to be.

Most recently, I received an email payment confirmation for a product I did not authorize. In working with Bluehost to resolve the issue and get a refund, both of my websites were deleted. This not only happened once but twice. It took nearly a month to finally resolve everything and get the refunds I thought were due me. Not all reps are knowledgeable and the services appear to be compartmentalized.

The use of my credit card without my authorization, the deletion of my websites, and the poor service was more than enough for me to move both websites and domain I'd had with Bluehost to a new hosting service.

"There is ABSOLUTELY no place on your site where we can reach out for support. Not even in newsletters. In contact us page there is lot of phone numbers to call. The norwegian number to Norway is NOT Bluehost support. It is to a car dealer in Norway.
My issue has been going on for many months. I had trouble with my account. Could not log in. Tried over and over again with new password. Suddenly, after maybe 6 months, i got an email with a link to ask them about this. The answer came: ""Your account is disabled."" Nothing about how to fix it, NOTHING!

---- Edit ----
You are writing you have sent me a request. You have not. This is just not good enough. You must add a ""Contact us"" page so we in fact contact you. No it is absolutely impossible!!! Facebook work though.","June 11, 2024",NO
I've been having email issues for months and each person claims to know the issue. I was told by one person that he would absolutely call me back and I never heard from him. I was assured by another person that someone from the team would email me. Never heard from them. I'm still having issues and just too exhausted to keep calling!,"June 05, 2024",US
"Bluehost customer support is useless. They automatically enrolled us in two factor to ""secure our account"" quite helpful as now nobody in our company can access it. This is not the first time we've had issues and their customer service reps just follow a script; but then they seem caught in a loop. Don't bother using them if you are hoping for any sort of support or reliability.

Update: Thank you for your reply. Just to clarify our last advice from BlueHost was to wait 24h and the problem would ""magically solve itself"".... surprisingly it has not self resolved and we STILL cannot access our account...

Update 2: Currently on hold with Bluehost. Waiting to speak to a manager to resolve the issue.

Update 3: We finally regained access to our website after 3 days of working with customer support. Thankfully we are into our account so we can transfer to a new provider. We waisted about 6 hours of labor fixing this issue. I suggest you review the call logs as the incompetence is astounding from the customer service reps... Hopefully we can stay in the account long enough to transfer the domain","June 08, 2024",CA
"Rude and slow client service, Incomplete Dashboard. It feels like they're actively trying to confuse users. You can only see the products that are close to renewal.","June 11, 2024",ZA
The absolute worst. Avoid them at all costs. I am so sorry I ever got involved with this company. Their customer support is the absolute worst. They are completely incompetent.,"June 11, 2024",US
"One star only because negative ten isn't available. Bluehost took my site offline with no warning nine months ago. Afterward they claimed an unused email on the account was spamming, and that all I had to do was reset passwords and contact customer service. They themselves spam so much and so frequently that the basic email on a major issue like this was lost in the flood of their junkmail. NINE months later and hundreds of hours with dozens customer service reps, the site is still blocked -- even though at the end of every chat session the rep claims the site 'will be active within hours.' They even had the nerve to charge me hundreds of dollars more for a renewal I didn't approve. I'm in discussion with lawyers to sue over breach of contract, negligence, and anything else I can find. This host site is a menace and I will never have anything to do with them or any business associated with them again.","June 10, 2024",US
"Bluehost emails seem like it stop working often. VERY UNSTABLE SO BEWARE IF EMAIL IS IMPORTANT TO YOUR BUSINESS. I spend more time trying to keep our email going than actually responding to received emails. Sad and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Lastly, their customer service is pretty bad. If the conversation isn't going well, they never send you the follow up survey questions. This guarantees they never get bad reviews. kind of scammy imo. Also, I asked them to speak in layman terms as I am not an admin, just a business owner trying to make our emails work. They didn't understand the phrase ""layman's terms"" which makes me believe English isn't their first language. Neither here nor there, just helpful if speaking technical terms to a non admin person.","June 08, 2024",US
"If they're incompetence with dealing with anything to do with abuse reports is anything to go by, so glad I'm not a customer of theirs.

I can't possibly put this into words how stupid this response is:
""Thanks for reaching out to us. I'm Rajesh, the compliance specialist, writing in response to your case regarding email issue. I understand your concern.

During my investigation, I have found that the domain xproject-dev.com MX records are not with us. To get this issue fixed please contact the email service provider of the domain. For more information you can check using the link :link to some nonsense about an MX record

Because we are not your email service provider, we would not be able to check the email issues on our end. We can troubleshoot email issues if the domain MX is pointed to our servers.


I hope this helps with your concern. Please let us know if you need further clarification or any assistance by submitting form at link to abuse form . We're happy to help you in any way we can.""

I wouldn't bother with this company even if they paid me to!","June 09, 2024",GB
