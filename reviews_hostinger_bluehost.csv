"I hate hostinger. I've been trying to log into my account for 20 minutes and it keeps telling me "" Error 1015
You are being rate limited"" and there is no way at all to log in to my account. Hostinger is expensive, they don't care about you once you buy hosting from them, they cheat with prices, you see a very low price at the beginning and then it turns out that this price is only low if you buy for a very long period. No technical support, only a robot. No possibility to log in and blocking access to the account. No clear information when you try to find the necessary information, for example for wordpress optimization or some settings. You have to really struggle to find the necessary tips.

"I've been with Hostinger for many years and I have quite a few domains with them and hosted websites. Suddenly, one of my domains has expired, but I never received a notification is was going to expire (due to Hostinger raising their prices without informing users, I have switched off auto-renewal on my services). While this should not be a problem and I could easily renew the domain, their interface doesn't let me do it, no one of the support team seems to know what's going on, and apparently the team who should handle this technical problem is not available on a weekend???

Of course, I cuted out from the bank screenshot all relevant information except the ones relative to the payment. Now I am closed out from site for god know how many days.

"I have never seen a customer service department refuse to listen to a customer like Hostingers customer service.

Then, when I checked the work, the site was messed up and plugins were missing (for instance, the All-In-One backup plugin, the one I used to send over). Many products were distorted. I ended up re-installing the backup that I originally had and that seems to do the trick. I will be paying close attention to the clock to cancel.

"This company is either corrupt or just incredibly incompetent. I spent 14 weeks fighting tooth and nail about the frequency of their DDoS attacks, but they did nothing to address the issue. I finally left a review here and sent a legal notice documenting the numerous times our sites were down—every day and then some. Once the review was posted, they reacted and set me up with a reliable server. We went without issues for about 4 weeks, and two days ago, I deleted the review.

Now, the problems have resurfaced. Yesterday, we were down 5 times. Today, we can’t see any graphics and can’t access the drop-down menu on another site. On a good day, they show no concern. They stack servers and have terrible defenses against DDoS attacks. These attacks happen to their IPs constantly, yet they do nothing about it, instead deflecting blame and making excuses about external factors like the wind or sun. They are not even trying to hide their incompetence. When the review is posted, our servers work perfectly. Without it, they fail constantly and daily. Additionally, they buy positive reviews that appear every 6 hours, all of which are fake.

"I have written a detailed review in the Reddit community and they deleted my review and banned my Reddit account.

Instead of providing a proper response or solution to my problems, there whole team will report the post to ban the account from Reddit.

Here are the main points from the review I have posted on Reddit.

1, Hpanel doesn't have a primary option for changing the domain.
2, Support people reply after 10 to 20 mins (each reply)
3, Support people only provide canned responses or knowledge base links.
4, They don't have temporary URLs, like Cloudways or Bluehost.
5, Their migration service is not useful they migrated my 3 websites and found that all the 3 website databases got messed up and mixed up.
6, If Hpanel doesn't have the option to change the URL being the admin their support people should be able to do it. But they won't and they will provide a reply which doesn't make any sense.

Hostinger take payment for services upfront within 2 days without allowing you to test or preview if what they offer will meet your requirements. I discovered you can’t add video backgrounds within your site and cannot easily embed video on your page either without following a lengthy non straight forward procedure. Also they could not provide a ticket counter to track ticket sales to show number of remaining tickets available for sale. And you have to wade through written explanations rather than can watch helpful videos. And getting a refund was not easy to do and was forecast to take 7-15 days.

oh i asked that question, crickets (meaning no reply), just repeating that i agree to the statement regarding desktop.

I think i'll cope without the extra 2% and would much prefer to know why this keeps occurring, how to avoid in future and efforts to fix/optimise mobile performance..... but that's not an option, desktop is the goal. Great, Not!

"VPS hosting plan: leur firewall ne fonctionne pas, je reçois des spams en très grand nombre et impossible de bloquer les ips. Je suis obligé de les bloquer au niveau de Ubuntu avec iptable.
Et à ce stade leur support technique est inexistant, on se contente de me transmettre des informations générales mais le pb n'est visiblement pas sérieusement regardé. inquiétant...

VPS hosting plan: their firewall is not working. I am spammed from ips which I am not able to block using their web interface. I have to block them at OS level. This is huge Security gap.
At that point the support from them is very very poor and I do not feel the issue is investigated. They just close the ticket giving me general information.
This should be a basic feature of my hosting plan and it is not delivered.
I hope I will have the opportunity to change my mind on all this soon...

reply from Hostinger team: they asked me to remove the rule which accepts https traffic from any ips. the problem is, per Hostinger's firewall own design, if I do this then all the traffic is blocked by default.
But if I were to be playful I would say that indeed, since it would block everyone, it would also block the malicious ips, so it is maybe a valid solution...

Conclusion: Ok so the conclusion is the following:
- you have to add a rule to accept HTTP traffic because by default the firewall reject all traffic.
- if you add a rule to drop a particular IP it won't work because of the above rule, and there is no way to set priorities among rules.

So this firewall is just impraticable by design, in case you want to block some ips for your server, unless maybe you want to specify manually ip ranges which excludes your blacklisted ips ( think about doing this for, say, 1000 ips...)

Here is the last condescending comment from customer service when asked about their design:

""
At the moment, we offer self-managed VPS hosting services, so you are responsible for all the work inside the server
I know that managing a VPS on your own might seem tough at first, but I can assure you that if you take some time to learn – you’ll be able to achieve anything!""

Hostinger's Firewall design is not my responsibility.

"Setting up the online payment gateway wasn't available for me, they asked me to upgrade. Isn't this a basic thing that should be mandatory no matter which plan I purchased?
Then they also didn't give the full refund, deducted 435 for domain. I asked to deactivate it, but they said if they do I won't be able to get the refund for it, how is this fair?
Now if I setup the website somewhere else, I'll have to go back and forth for the domain instead of just setting it up in the new platform.

"Please read my bottom two paragraph added information for my response to Hostinger's reply.

Hostinger has at least two problems. One is false or misleading (at best) advertising - the other is no understanding of customer value - which I still think is important for any business that wants to be viewed as professional and worthy of customer loyalty. I am a very dissapointed current customer. I will be happy to provide more info to anyone interested - but I suspect this review will be sufficient info for you.

I saw your response and I want to make this clear to you and all review readers. If you are offering $20 off a $100 yearly purchase amount, and you are forced to buy a minimum of 2 years, you need to pay $180 and you are getting $20 off a $200 minimum qty purchase. For any educated buyer, they will realize that is a 10% discount, not a 20% discount. Your sales page does not disclose the 2-year minimum purchase. Would it be correct to say you are giving 40% off a six-month purchase which would be the same 10% of the minimum quantity purchase? Because you are Lithuanian-based it must be tempting to skirt truthful advertising laws in the US but that will not result in your being trusted here. I hope you want to, and can do better.

Who is the domain registry? Do they force you to sell at a specified price? Do they force you to offer a 2-year minimum purchase? Do they force you to say that is 20% off?",2024-08-04,US,price or payment,0.5093395113945007,North america,Hostinger

"I am ""customer"" of the """"service privider"""" hostinger for 10 years. Every month I need to be fighting with them. They do not respect the ICANN laws. They over charge for domain registration by $4 dollars per domain registration or renewal. They constantly try to charge me to services I already paid, like email, more speed, you name it. Sometimes I register domains and they fail to complete registration BUT they do not refund the funds, they keep them. You need to spend 30 minutes with ""tech support"" to ask why they did not complete domain registration first, then ask manually for the refund. I have lost 5 domains like that, no only the domains for 3 of the fees. Because if you don't keep sharp track of things they will slip their hand into your pocket anytime they can.
Recently I lost a domain because 1) they failed to complete auto-renewal 2) by lay ICANN set grace period of 0-45 days but they scam you in the 10th day, then they buy the domain you want to recover and re-sell it to you on 50 times more the price.

This is a predatory business and the service was good, but now the service and price is not recommendable.

"we have a 2 page website which is basically trying to build a community to take legal action as a group against a popular trading platform who has been systematically defrauding their clients to the tune of at least £50m over 3 years, we have undisputable evidence and have a complaint with the FCA & FOS, Hostinger suddenly took the site down without any notice before or after stating “Your website is currently not working because the XXXXXXXXXXXXX.com has been suspended due to suspicious activity. To investigate if your order can be unsuspended, please contact us. Our team will handle your case and get back to you” We have checked their terms of business and we have not breached any of their terms, so to cut a long story short, it seems they execute first and if you complain they then start to investigate! to me it shows great care for their clients

Dear Hostinger

We would like to clarify that we are not requesting the unsuspension of our account. However, we are deeply concerned about the handling of this situation.

First, we were not notified prior to the suspension of our website, which is a significant oversight on your part. Furthermore, the reason for the suspension was not clearly communicated to us. We were simply told it was due to ""abuse,"" without any specific details regarding the alleged trademark infringement.

We have thoroughly reviewed the trademark registrations of the company in question and can confirm that our website content does not infringe upon their trademarks. It is particularly concerning that the company alleging infringement has not contacted us directly about this issue. Instead, they chose to go through Hostinger, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. This suspicion is further fuelled by Hostinger's repeated failure to respond to our requests for clarification regarding both the alleged infringement and any possible conflicts of interest.

Moreover, our website's purpose is to organise and support legal action for victims of the other company. This makes Hostinger's actions even more troubling, as they appear to hinder efforts to hold a potentially fraudulent entity accountable.

We expect a prompt and detailed response explaining why Hostinger did not notify us before suspending our account, what the exact nature of the alleged infringement is, and why there has been no direct communication from the company claiming infringement. Additionally, we seek clarification on any potential conflict of interest that Hostinger may have in this matter.

Received on the 08/08/24 from Hostinger

Dear customer,

We thank you for your patience.

We have investigated the case and we can see that we indeed received an abuse report for your website dXXXXXXXXXX212.com. In response to this report, the website was suspended by our automation.

We have now unsuspended the website. Please be assured that the team responsible for the automation is looking into why this happened as well.

We apologise for the inconvenience.

"I am a blogger, and I will refuse to use hostinger to become a blogger. I have many domains registered with different registrars like HostGator, Dynadot, Namecheap, and GoDaddy, and I have never faced any issues like this before. However, when I bought a domain from Hostinger, it got suspended within 2 days. How does such a large company benefit from an ID card for security?

Why have a resource monitor page that shows you have not gone over the limit, yet apparently I have. (I have not, simply because all my web sites are small and low on inodes and files.

Let the buyer beware should be your mantra if dealing with Hostinger.

You advertise a price for hosting for $43.xx per year without mention of the renewal price for the second year being $143.xx.

Hostinger doesn't make renewal prices visible in the initial adverts - for hosting or domain names.

I am extremely disappointed with Hostinger's hosting service and their so-called technical team. My experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.

I requested a website transfer from one Hostinger account to another for my website.

It has been more than 8 days since I opened the ticket, and my hosting has expired while the website transfer remains unresolved. This level of incompetence is simply unacceptable.

The lack of efficiency and communication has caused my hosting to expire, exacerbating the problem. The so-called technical support team appears more focused on offering empty apologies than on actually resolving the issue.

If you're considering Hostinger, beware. They lack the professionalism and capability to handle even the simplest requests. Based on my experience, I strongly advise seeking a more reliable hosting provider.

I appreciate the website builder, but there’s a major issue with the video aspect. When uploading a video, it appears unprofessional due to a popup button directing users to Google Drive. The alternative options, such as YouTube links (what if clients don’t have YouTube accounts/videos) and embedded codes have bugs and problems.

Please consider adding a simple option to upload videos directly from a computer, similar to Wix.

I am utterly disappointed and frustrated with the abysmal service provided by Hostinger.

These websites are not just a personal project, they are my sole source of income, and Hostinger's negligence has cost me dearly.

The ordeal doesn't end there. Every time I reach out to Hostinger's customer service for assistance, I am thrown into a never-ending loop of redirection. Each agent I speak to asks me to wait, only to pass me on to another agent, forcing me to re-explain the issue from scratch. This cycle repeats ad nauseam, with no resolution in sight.

I'm confused as to why the option to transfer the VPS from one location to another was removed, especially when it's a useful feature for moving files and snapshots.

Its a horrible experience and I will not use their service again. Never I will suggest someone to purchase hostingeer. Even support team is not helpful to this from there end",2024-07-02,SA,customer support,0.4933742582798004,Middle east,Hostinger
"Hostingers are frauds. They draw us in with low prices and once in, give you the mere basics, Then they upsell you on things at fraudulent prices. I purchased a hosting package that said it includes a free email. However, when I went to add the complimentary email. The free option was not obvious so I thought I had to purchase the email, so I did not question it Two months later, on today, I was going to purchase a new domain. They advertised price was $7.99 yr. On a 2yr plan at check out, the total was $ 24.95 at check and on a 3 yr plan at checkout the total was $47.98. I initially contacted them to ask what are the undisclosed fees or charges. This is when I was reminded that I paid for an enhanced email upgrade I didn't need. Because, the free option was not readily obvious. I asked them to see if I could get a coupon code for the new domain. Being that they knew they promoted the inhansed email over the free option and it was too late for a refund. They just stopped communicating. Not a good company, they are not good people. I guarantee they are not a USA company. They have NO integrity in their operations. I rather pay more at company with integrity.

My website is not working, and so I wanted to contact support. To do so, I had to ridiculously google how to get in contact with chat, because from their pages, I constantly got send --sometimes with a detour-- to the same FAQ page. Finally I got to talk with a chat....robot.

I wanted to figure out what was wrong, but everywhere you click on their dashboard, you get redirected to a page where you can upgrade or pay for getting the feature.

This includes:
Move website - should have been free
Domain name - should have been free
Email address - should have been free

This is how I ended up paying for a domain name, which should be free in the package I bought. I was doing everything according to the mails, to move my old website to the new one, but it didn't work? So when I click on: move website to Hostinger, it tells me I have to pay for it.

However, the resources they promise, like CPU and other specifications, often fall short. As a long-time Hostinger user, I'm now trying to migrate to another server. Unfortunately, finding unbiased reviews is incredibly difficult. Most review sites and YouTube channels appear more interested in advertising than providing genuine insights.

"Absolutely horrible.

I have a webshop at Hostinger, used to be Zyro, for at least two years now. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I still have it Purly because I worked very hard on it, spent many many hours on it, and it's finally OK now.

Hostinger is not easy to use. I can't find basic stuff like rearranging products to your liking. There are FAQ's but even those don't work sometimes. For example : I'm selling digital downloadable images. But Hostinger doesn't have the basic option to not enlarge the picture when you click on it. So people can click on it, have it big, and make a screenshot.
I have had many chats with the AI chat and in real live chats. They frequently say that they don't have functions available yet. Basic functions!
Also I have to switch browsers sometimes because sometimes things don't work on Chrome. Imagine all the time I put into figuring this out....

Also, it took more than a year to finally have my description of my Internet page right. Yes, I also chatted with someone from Hostinger about it, they said they couldn't do anything about it. It took a year of waiting!

Now another thing. My website isn't always working for the public. I even got emails from buyer that they couldn't see my products. After I went to the website builder and did absolutely nothing, things got right again. But I don't want to check my website everytime just to make sure it's working properly.

"I have been a Hostinger customer for the past 7 months, and overall, my experience has been quite positive. The service and customer support have been excellent and beyond my expectations. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making managing my site a breeze. Plus, the pricing is very competitive for the high-quality service they provide.

However, I recently encountered an issue that has left me feeling disappointed. When I initially signed up, I had several conversations with Hostinger representatives and conducted thorough research. I was assured by multiple representatives and their AI support that upgrading to meet my future needs would be straightforward, especially as my websites grow and require more resources, such as adding large content like videos. Based on these assurances, I felt confident in choosing Hostinger for my business.

Now, as my business needs have evolved, I find myself needing to upgrade from the Cloud Startup plan to a VPS hosting plan. Unfortunately, I have been informed that this upgrade is not possible at all. This has left me feeling misled, as I now face the prospect of paying hundreds of dollars for new hosting, making my current Cloud Startup plan feel like a wasted investment in terms of my business goals as it becomes useless to have two hosting.",2024-06-25,CA,customer support,0.6136919856071472,North america,Hostinger

"Transferred my websites to different server - effectively making them unreachable for hours.

Hostinger sent an email (just one email) they'll move my server. OK, that acceptable... sort of. I'd expect more time or more reminders.

The catch?
- they won't share the IP where the site will go until it happens
- they won't share when it's going to happen but left a day long period

This effectively made my websites go down, because I wasn't available when the server changed.

This is absolutely unacceptable. I can't fathom who gave greenlight to this workflow.

Just think about that discussion:

'hey we need to move some servers.

OK when it's going to happen?

We don't know exactly, but we know a rough date.

Ok notify the customers just once, send them an email and don't tell them anything just explain the impact. And tell them to be ready.

This is impactful, email can end up in spam or not being delivered or missed easily. Shall we do some more communication points?

No, just one email, weeks ahead. It's enough.

Shall we offer some buffer period or at least an IP address of the server or any detail?

No, they can probably wait entire day for our email and they can act once we send the notification of change (via email again.) '

Customer orientation 0, customer focus 0, customer empathy 0.

Products are ok, but it's hosting. All hosting' providers are almost the same these days. It's the help that matters at the most important moments.

I will definitely move my websites elsewhere.

"I consider myself a hosting and networking vet, having use many different company over the years.

Hostinger makes big promises when they advertise their plans. They say you can have 2 cores , 250 nvme storage, 3GB Ram,
Unlimited Databases, 100 PHP Workers, 2M inodes, up to 300 websites, fast WordPress sites, etc., but that's not really true if you use only WordPress sites.

They have a secret limitation on the hard drive usage that they don't readily tell you about at the time when you buy any of their Cloud Plans. (hostinger-com/cloud-hosting)

This SECRET limit is called Throughput I/O of ONLY 10,000 KB.. Yes that is Kilobytes.

Even though a server hard drive can handle a lot more throughput, they only let it process this small amount of data as you add your websites.

This limit will slow down all your websites, even though they say you can have up to 300 sites, when really you can't get past 4 or 5 comfortably. You'll keep getting errors like 200, 403, and 502, and you'll lose clients because of it. And Hostinger will blame it on your sites, your plugins, lack of caching, etc., when really there is no true way you can find where the usages are coming from, and which sites... If this is even true. Their excuse is that they have to have this limitation in place for other users.... Ok, wait! The cloud Plan I purchased isn't some cheap Shared-hosting plan so why would they tell me that??

This Throughput I/O limitation is NOT even in their hosting agreement (hostinger-com/legal/hosting-agreement). Check for yourself.

Just one WordPress site install can actually hit this limit. Why do Hostinger have this limit when other hosting companies don't usually have this kind of limitation. I lost $425 and a client because of this problem.

So far I request a refund for the lack of informing the customer before buying, and so far they have denied me, and even denied to even remove this limitation off. So instead of them taking care of a spending customer, they rather allow users to go ahead submit reviews, that will inform others about this carefully hidden issue.

I don't recommend Hostinger. If a price is too good to be true. Believe it.

Instead, my recommendation is to go with one of the big six: AWS, Google cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, Vultr, or Linode. Use some server management software like CloudPanel, etc., to freely manage any these. You'll get better service without any limitations.

Dear Hostinger Representatives,
I am officially lodging a complaint with your company.

On June 23, 2024, our website became inaccessible to visitors. We had received no prior notification or warning from you about this issue. We only learned about it when our customers began informing us that they could not access our site.
Upon checking our account dashboard, we found the following message:

""Hosting plan is suspended
Your website is currently not working because the has been suspended due to suspicious activity. To investigate if your order can be unsuspended, please contact us. Our team will handle your case and get back to you shortly.""

We subsequently reached out to you requesting the restoration of our hosting service and clarification regarding the suspension. In response, we received the following message from you:

""Hello,
Thank you for reaching us.
Regarding the suspension, I have forwarded your case to our Abuse team for review.
As it requires a deep investigation, it might take up to 5 business days for the relevant team to provide an update.
No worries, we will inform you the moment we have more information!
This chat will reopen automatically and you will receive an email with all the relevant details. You can also track the status of this ticket in the Help page of hPanel, like so.""

As an online store, we cannot afford to wait for such a prolonged period for your response. Waiting for 5 business days will cause us significant financial losses, and we will be seeking compensation from your company for these losses:
1) To avoid substantial losses, we urgently request that you restore our hosting service as soon as possible!
2) Additionally, we are unable to access our database and our files. These are our commercial property. Therefore, we urgently request that you provide us with access to our database and files!

"All I can say is unbelievable!

I don’t know where to start, had so many issues in past few years.

I get a resource notification that I need to upgrade my cloud hosting. The problem is that its coming from Disk Usage. My current Disk Usage is 2%, lolo I am using 5GB out of 250GB. HUH? How on earth can I be using too much disk space when I use like 2 % of it?

Not just that, a few days ago I could not even load any website and then after so much time with support, they finally decided to move my hosting to another server. The very next day I go to the websites to work on WordPress site, and it freezes up, then I check the rest of the websites and sure enough, wont load or extremely slow. I contact support and must wait and try to get a real person as thew BOT Emily keeps on posting issues with optimization on websites. I have had these same websites up and running VERY optimized without many issues in the past year except server concerns. I run WP Rocket and always optimize all my websites as I have been doing this for over 15 years. On a side note, same technology running on c panel shows almost perfect results in Lighthouse and speed test such as GTMetrix. I also have tested all the sites with same tools on this Hostinger Cloud server and same thing, great results but they keep on coming back and coming up with excuses.

I am not one to make complaints or reviews, but I have had it with their excuses. It does not seem to help when I contact support as I get know where with MOST of them. Some support staff is very helpful like DIEGO, very knowledgeable and always willing to help.
If you look at my resou7rce usage, its such a joke as I am barely using anything. In fact, I have even deleted some websites I don’t host anymore, and it seems like the lower the websites, the more issues.
Here are some details about all resources - 12% of resources used in the last 24 hours.
Here are the details about the so-called resource limit reached - Disk usage limits peaked 40 minutes. I am ONLY using 2% so how on earth can this be?

The cost is great, but you get what you pay for and in this case, I am not even getting that in my opinion. I asked to speak with supervisor, nope, I asked for management email, nope. You can’t even make a complaint to anyone. So, this brings me to this review. I need to warn others. This is the email I got just before this review - Action needed: You have outgrown your hosting plan. I have no idea how this could be true as I don’t even come close to outgrowing my resources.

UPDATE *****
OK, so the issues continue to happen…
This morning, I logged into TWO websites to do some WordPress updates on the plugins. The sites started to bow down again and at times, gave me a 500 error and would not load. Contacted support, took a LONG time to get someone and after she looked at it, came back with a link to optimize my websites and showed images of spiked resource for memory. I looked at it and it was from the resource levels, my average memory used is 500 MB, I have or suppose to have 6144 memory with my hosting. It spiked to 900 MB, I am suppose to have 6144 memory. HUH? How on earth would this cause my websites to not load? Also, checked the CPU and it spiked to 22 %, don’t I have like 78% left?

Not even close to going to my limits. My websites are also to 95% speed all the time and all my images are ALWAYS optimized. I have been doing this for many years and its like they don’t think I know what I am doing. Even with spikes in traffic or DDOS attacks, the resources show that I should have plenty to accomodate and get the websites ot load decently.

Look at the disk space, I was also getting a notice saying I needed to upgrade my hosting because disk space was reaching limits. I am at 3% disk Space - what? but they wanted me to upgrade my service because I was using 2-3% disk space.

PLEASE be mindful when using these people as in my opinion its not worth the stress and headache and I am moving my websites out and will loose close to 1 year left of service, but the stress is not worth staying and having my clients get upset because their websites won’t load.",2024-06-20,IN,customer support,0.5643219351768494,Asia,Hostinger
"The only reason this isn't 1 star is because they are cheap.

Our email accounts were hacked. All of them. Pretty nutty because the main service is via a gmail and I know that this one wasn't hacked. Tried to change everything up, nothing. We spent probably 100 hours on our side tracing down problems to fix it with no customer support.

Today? Well, Hostinger decided to block my hope IP address without warning. I am still on hold for 25 minutes in a chat where nobody has responded. I can't access my emails without a VPN. Pretty bad. Really, really bad.

Pretty much every month there is a new problem that arises. I couldn't tell you what or why. I can just tell you that you will continually be chasing problems if you actually use Hostinger for anything but a junko, cheap website.

"I submitted a ticket for account email change and they asked for way more data than they should or need given what they already have stored on their system.

I said no to photo ID, so they asked for the payment credit card photo showing only the last four digits plus the account's holder name. I sent a photo of the payment card showing the name of my manager as I purchased the product for my department plus a photo of one of my credit cards only showing my name. Still after all the effort I made they just closed the ticket and left the request pending for over a month now. I contacted them at least three times just to be asked to fill in the same form and upload the same evidence over and over and over again with a promise someone will get back within two business days. I am aware they are struggling to accept my challenging their request for a photo ID and I will never do as turning a web hosting service into an intelligence gathering agency is not what Hostinger has been authorised to operate in the UK for.

"I would not recommend using Hostinger. Pay close attention to what others are saying. When selecting a hosting, I saw a negative review of Hostinger and dismissed it as an exception. Unfortunately, my experience proved otherwise.

I purchased a domain through Hostinger and built a personal website, investing significant time and effort. However, just three days after launching, my site was suspended. Hostinger accused me of violating their terms and conditions due to a trademark issue with another company that had a similar name to my domain. I was completely unaware of the existence of this other company.

It turned out that the domain name suggested by Hostinger's recommendation engine appeared to violate someone else's trademark. How was I supposed to know this if Hostinger itself didn’t initially identify the domain name as an issue?

Hostinger also suspended my access to all the source code for my website, which did not violate any terms and represented a week's worth of work. I have been unable to regain access and now face the prospect of rebuilding everything from scratch. In addition, I was waiting a week for them to review my case and it was just a time lost. Hostinger refused to lift the suspension and showed no interest in negotiating. They also declined to refund my purchase or provide another domain and migrate the source code.
As a business owner and manager, I find their level of service unacceptable and unprofessional, especially for a company of Hostinger's size. I would strongly recommend passing them by.",2024-06-16,AR,suspended or blocked,0.4995723068714142,South america,Hostinger

"After months of problems with Hostgator VPS, I've decided to change to Hostinger and guess what? Problems... I love Hostinger VPS, but when you face a problem, they don't care if all your websites are offline, my websites have been offline since yesterday, and first thing in the morning when I'm checked again... same thing, call for support all the sites offline and no solutions, they've said that they are investigating but never found a solution and my website follows ALL OFFLINE til the moment!!!
Looking at the documentation on Hostinger I found something about the CPU usage, which I think is my problem, so they say...

""CPU
When you reach the maximum threshold for available CPU, your website becomes slower and starts scheduling requests from your visitors instead of serving them instantly. There will be no error messages, but the website will feel sluggish.

Find out your website's peak hours and ensure your CPU stays below 80% during the busiest times. This will guarantee that all visitors have the best possible experience on your website. ""

But they didn't mention in the documentation that they will cut you off and all websites on your VPS will be shutting down, which is my case.

Resume of the history, if you are in a shared host on Hostinger and things go well DON'T MIGRATE TO VPS! End of the story, on HostGator I've problems with memory usage, on Hostinger is CPU so, be careful when you decide to change!!!

End of the day and things are going as same, even after the Hostinger reply, they did do nothing about it, so if you see a reply in bad reviews, know that is like a robot replying, already stopped my server by now and put all my websites to sleep because my VPS SERVER KVM 2 simply not work, another thing that I clarifying here is that on my VPS Panel I have the upgrade button but the downgrade is missing... So... The support does nothing to help, and if you upgrade your server, there is no way to downgrade besides speaking with chat support that does nothing, be advised!!!!

They shut down my VPS, all my websites are offline, and nobody is doing anything to help solving the situation, my VPS is not manageable because of high usage of CPU and I can do nothing, so the only way to work on the problem is to upgrade, but if I upgrade that's no way back, I need to buy a new VPS and start all the configuration aand migration of files to the new VPS, now answer me, this a way to work on a hosting company? Put your client in a position where they can do nothing to solve a problem and nobody does anything to help. Worst company ever, if the services are working ok, if you have a problem you`re dead!!!

Gateway Timeout
The gateway did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or application.

This is what HOSTINGER will do for your business!

Update 06-18-2024I still have the same problems with Hostinger's policy to put all websites on a VPS to sleep, here is the thing, if your VPS gets to 100% of CPU usage, they will put all your websites on your VPS to sleep, yes, on your Hostinger panel will appear that your server has a restriction and all your websites will be offline and with this restriction you will not able to do nothing and the VPS team, the only people that can help you out will take 3 days to respond one ticket and in my case, even when they respond telling that the problem was solved, my websites were offline, so last week I've decided to delete everything, and after reinstall all again, I start today having same issues with the server, so be advised, if you have a VPS and your server get 100% of CPU usage they will put down all the websites on your VPS and put a restriction so you will not able to do anything...

"Hostinger Hosting Service Review: An Exercise in Frustration
I recently transitioned all my websites to Hostinger for hosting and even purchased several domains from them, only to be met with a deeply disappointing experience. Their customer service is, frankly, abysmal unless you’re looking to earn a degree in web hosting.

Customer Service: A Nightmare
Hostinger’s lack of contact numbers is the first red flag. They boast a 24/7 chat box for support, but all you get are written instructions. This so-called ""support"" feels more like an online tutorial than actual assistance. You're essentially taught to solve issues yourself, turning a simple query into a frustrating ordeal. By the time you’re done, not only do you detest the chat box, but you also grow to resent the company as a whole.

Non-Responsive Leadership
I even reached out to the CEO in hopes of finding a resolution, but received no response. Having spent my life in the business world, I know the importance of responding to service issues. This CEO appears to be completely detached from customer concerns, which is unacceptable.

False Advertising
Hostinger’s advertising is, in my opinion, not worth the paper it’s written on. They promise a seamless experience but fail to deliver on basic customer service. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" rings true here—they provide the hosting infrastructure but offer no real help beyond that.

The Bottom Line
If you’re not interested in obtaining a Master's degree in IT and website management, I’d strongly advise looking elsewhere for hosting services. Find a company that offers genuine help and customer service. Hostinger provides virtually none, leaving you to navigate a frustrating mess on your own.

In conclusion, don't just walk away from Hostinger—run. Their lack of effective support and misleading advertising make them a poor choice for hosting services. Save yourself the headache and find a provider that truly values their customers.",2024-06-05,US,customer support,0.9056209921836852,North america,Hostinger

"Yesterday from 8 PM, there was no service availability. Our store went down, and Hostinger didn't even inform us about it. Only today, around 9 AM, they restored the store from the previous day's backup, so all orders from yesterday disappeared, and Hostinger offered us an additional 10 days of free service as compensation. We have purchased the highest service package, yet they treat us like an unimportant customer and disregard our reputational losses and the fact that we lost an entire day in the system and are unable to recover it. This is what their backup and support look like. They keep passing us to another person and completely ignore our problems caused by them. In such issues, the support is disastrous, and the company takes no responsibility for anything. Moreover, there are more such outages, usually lasting several dozen minutes, but this time they outdid themselves; we lost customer data and were left completely alone. Don't believe their claims about availability and full security.

Another day has passed, and we are still cleaning up after the data loss caused by Hostinger. As a laughable compensation, they first offered to extend our subscription by 7 days, then 10 days, then another person offered 7 days again, and yesterday it was a WHOLE 2 months, which at our rate is worth about 50 EUR. Meanwhile, we continue to bear the consequences of their lack of security and waste our time. If you really don't want to lose your valuable data, do not use this provider.

"I am extremely disappointed with Hostinger. After purchasing a VPS subscription, web hosting, and a domain from them, I quickly realized that their VPS hosting was not what I needed. I canceled my VPS hosting and web hosting on the same day and switched to A2 Hosting for managed hosting.

During the process of transferring my domain to A2 Hosting, something went wrong. Hostinger informed me that my domain was marked as spam for unknown reasons. This is unacceptable. It is not normal for this to happen during a simple transfer process. I believe that this issue arose because of Hostinger's handling of the transfer.

I got the domain name only three days ago and decided to switch hosting providers, and now my domain is unfairly marked as spam. Hostinger needs to take responsibility for this problem. Their poor handling of the transfer has caused significant delays and frustration.

I would not recommend Hostinger to anyone looking for reliable hosting services. Their actions have been incredibly unprofessional and have caused me unnecessary trouble.",2024-06-04,NL,customer support,0.5774348378181458,Europe,Hostinger
"Used Hostinger for 7 months without issue. Then one day they had scheduled in some maintenance to my server (without communicating this with me). They said the maintenance was complete without any issue, but my entire website was 404’d.

You can only contact customer service via email and - unsurprisingly - this is not a quick way to get your website back up and running. Despite claiming they respond within 1 business day, I am still yet to receive a response to any of my emails of complaint from 7+ days ago.

Recently, my business website and all its subdomains (which I use as test servers to host my clients' websites) were suddenly suspended by Hostinger. They informed me that there was a script/virus on one of the sites. I don't know about it but i acknowledged the issue and asked them to either remove it or allow me to do so in order to have the sites unsuspended.

I registered my complaint on May 31st, and their support team kept telling me that the abuse team, which works in different time zones, would handle the unsuspension. However, five days later, all of my websites remained suspended, despite the issue being isolated to only one website. Their support team has been unhelpful, repeatedly sending the same generic responses.

As a result of their negligence, I have suffered significant losses. If they are unable to handle such issues properly, they should not have suspended the websites.

Re-evaluate your fraud detection and traction policy. You lost me as a customer today. My account was some how flagged by your system. Without notification or warning the account was shutdown and the site was pulled. My email was taken offline. Only after I went through a bunch of prompts to stop me from speaking to an actual person to save your company money was I able to get a hold of someone who told me I needed to verify my credit card. Had I not reached out I would have never received notification that my account was shut down or that I had the ability to restore it. Once I did get instructions on how to restore it I needed to upload a picture of my credit card (not s good idea) and upload proof of payment. At this time I decided that if a company would take the rash decision to close my site down and lock me out without notice it was time to find another host. Unfortunately it has been painful trying to reclaim my domain name now. From a consumer point of view it seems like you have my url held hostage without reason other than commercial.

"Refused to refund for overcharging and correct fee for upcoming renewals

I have been with Hostinger from March 2022 on the Cloud Enterprise Plan which I signed up for $99.99 monthly. Some time last year, the company slashed prices to $64.99 on the same monthly plan except that reduction was not effected on my plan. When i queried, I was told it was a promotional offer. Today, 2024/05/29 the price is still the same for new sign ups. In fact, if you sign up today you get charged $64.99 and it renews at the same price meaning there is no promotion on the monthly package. I requested that my charge be matched with the current renewal price but they refuse. Instead, they offered me a 35% relief for the next renewal only but it would then come back to the hefty $99.99 they have been charging me. This is unfair to me as I am using the same service that new sign ups are using. Also, being a monthly deal, I should not be bound by the prices of 2 years ago when it was expensive. Would have loved to stay because their service in other areas wasn't bad but the refusal to address the overcharging by way of refund or future tokens is very unfair on my part. If they rectified the charges for all upcoming renewals it would have been fair, but no, they just can't admit they overcharged me.",2024-05-29,ZA,price or payment,0.6315791606903076,Africa,Hostinger

"Nobody answers emails to customer service at all, it was hard enough to find it. Nor to the ""quality"" email address they provide here in replies, what a joke.
I then had to switch computer and browser to use their chat, after having to click through a ton of non relevant topics. No option for hosted websites in the help menu (to contact Cs) at all.
My websites were ALL down / error message, while the admin panel said always ""okay"" . In months I never received a notification about this.
There's a useless ai tool, telling me to contact customer service.
So when I managed to get someone in the chat and it took forever for him to get back to me with the info, it turned out out ALL my websites were shut down by hostinger, bec supposedly 1 had an installation of a free LMS on it, from years ago (if I understood correctly, it wasn't easy to understand and they called it ""CMS"").
No notification about any of this in time, let alone any offer to resolve the issue they have created.
I still don't know if my email had worked even, CS in chat wouldn't reply to half of the things I asked and each reply took a very long time, altogether hours.
All I know I have been losing business for 3 months without knowing about this.
Hostinger has 100 percent lost my trust.
So, support in the chat made everything available again, I spent the rest of the evening, after losing the day on this (because I followed steps in their useless troubleshooting website after I got no help earlier), finally posting a blog post and then social media for it - - only to have the same error again!
No reply via email. Invhat again endless waiting, all in all hours. CS lady copy pasting and being condescending, basically telling me I was a malicious scammer bec I had years! ago installed the open source LMS Chamilo. So, one day, hostinger decides that LMS is a threat to them and suspend all my websites without a notification. Last night, after the websites were back online, they were suspended again, because the first CS representative had not emptied the trash folder, he had simply moved the installation there.
Great working, your automated systems hostinger, your serbmvice has declined to the point of unacceptable and I will look for a different holster today. Your CS denied to tell me how to cancel.
Even the process and shutting down the website in question without my consent and knowledge isn't OK, but sabotaging my business on various other websites?! What do I pay for for business hosting when my business is sabotaged, no apology for my losses, and no reply to my emails.

A few months later I noticed that pages with a 500 error often began to appear, then it didn’t work at all for about half an hour, they said something was wrong with the servers. Even then I had the idea to refuse their services. Then I received letters about copyright infringement with a request to remove the content on the site page, although there cannot be any violation there, on the page there is only an image I made and a little text. The fact is that I don’t even know what kind of violation there might be and asked them about it, but there was no answer. They simply responded to someone’s complaint without even understanding it. Another site was blocked even without warning. Then another site was blocked without warning. In this regard, I had to urgently leave this terrible company. I ask the Hostinger company not to look for my account, I have already moved away from you. Thank you for your services. One good thing is that I paid for the service only for a year, but used it for half a year. And the price is at least twice as high even with all the discounts, compared to other companies. And one more thing, how they deceive people and write in their personal account that your site has worked poorly for the last 24 hours and please switch to a more expensive service, although in fact I just made a site and it didn’t even work for one hour, like this their marketing.
So, to summarize: the price for such a service is too high, the same failures in operation as on cheap hostings, they can ask you to delete content without explaining a specific reason, there is support, but they respond with standard replies, a few more little things, but I won’t bother with them anymore. I’ll just say that all those who want to order a service from hosting should think about it very carefully, I, in turn, do not recommend doing this.

Things did run smoothly until I needed them to help me resolve problems with web and email hosting.

Talked to five different guys about the same issue, got four different answers that were completely incompatible, and worst of all, none of them worked.

The cherry on top of this useless support service is the exorbitant fees they charge. Don't even bother with BlueHost, not worth it at all.

EDIT: To lower the rating from 2 to 1: After I just confronted the agent for being absolutely clueless, they of course didn't want to be rated badly.

So the agent sent me fake survey message, I let them know that the message looks different than automated message and they denied it lol If the survey message were actually real, then agent wouldn't be able to respond to me anymore!!

I clicked on my taskbar icon for Bluehost (a 3x3 grid of blue squares) which usually takes me to my webmail login. Instead it brought me to my account login. I entered the information correctly, thinking I would then find the entry to my webmail. I clicked ""Login"" and the blue banner just faded in and out.

Since I run a medical practice through this site, I called Customer Support to get functionality back.

During this meaningless back-and-forth, I became impatient and simply went back to my existing login link. Lo and behold, the usual instrument came up, allowing me to login to my webmail without difficulty. I am not sure what the Customer service rep did while she was making me respell my name and account name, but she did not divulge what had happened.

I had a frustrating and disappointing experience with Bluehost. They wrongly charged my account for domain renewals and added Domain Privacy + Protection services without my consent. Despite not authorizing these charges, they were still added to my billing, which is completely unacceptable.

To make matters worse, when I tried to resolve the issue through their support chat, the representative (Shamanth) disconnected the chat without providing any assistance. The support was utterly useless and left me with no answers or solutions.

I’ve requested a refund for these unauthorized charges, but if I don’t receive one soon, I’ll have to escalate the issue by filing disputes with PayPal and my credit card company.

After consulting a technical expert, I was advised to contact my business email provider as the issue seems to stem from the DSN, which can be affected during web host updates.

This happened again on my second call, and it became clear that the responders lacked the technical expertise needed to address my problem.

"I cannot believe the sheer audacity of HostMonster and Bluehost. These companies are absolute disasters. My hosting account has been a nonstop nightmare, with servers hacked on a weekly basis. It's like they're running a charity for hackers!

To add insult to injury, someone managed to access my panel and purchase a whopping 25 domains without my authorization. Despite having two-factor authentication set up, their security is about as effective as a paperclip. When I finally realized the mess, I contacted support and was met with a shocking level of incompetence.

It took them over a week to even acknowledge the problem, let alone start to fix it. When I demanded a concrete timeline, the support rep abruptly ended the chat. I tried to escalate the issue to a manager, but they seemed to have vanished into thin air.

HostMonster and Bluehost are a disgrace to the hosting industry. Their servers are a breeding ground for hackers, their security is a joke, and their customer support is non-existent.

Aside from that, sometimes my website just stops working for no reason and I have to contact customer service.

"A domain was sitting on Hostgator and our client wanted off of it. Hostgator is another awful hosting company. They made the mistake of choosing Bluehost, without asking for our recommendation. They moved it off Hostgator but it never really moved to Bluehost. However, Bluehost's incompetent agents, reading off scripts and wasting our time with platitudes, couldn't realize what was wrong and after DAYS of chatting with different agents, and escalating it to advanced support, they figured out the issue. A bigger problem was that we couldn't see what was wrong because their Cpanel was not working and was repeatedly showing a missing 404 page. In the near week that I dealt with them, they still had not fixed their own backend. They keep spewing malarkey that the issue is just propagation and we have to be patient to wait the 48 HOURS and the problem would fix itself. After a wasted two days that our client's site is DOWN, the site is still not working and they investigate again and find another issue and promise that it will be fixed after another 48 HOURS of propagation. Of course it wasn't and our client is freaking out by now. We had to do all the investigation and figure out what was going on. The representatives are useless, incompetent and clearly, poorly trained. Any website that needs to be up at all times should stay FAR AWAY from this company. They offer nothing and at higher than normal pricing. They try to lure you in with first year discounted pricing but then you pay more than better hosting companies after the first year.

They sent a renewal notice for my hosting, but under the name of a no-longer-registered subdomain that hasn't been used in many years. So naturally I said I didn't want to renew it. But the renewal wasn't for the subdomain, it was for the primary domain.
Why didn't they use my customer ID or primary domain in the renewal notice? Who knows! But I lost everything with no way to retrieve it.
That's about as bad as it gets.
UPDATE Aug 17:
Bluehost read my review and contacted me directly.
After originally being told by their online support that my site was lost and nothing could be done, the escalation team helped me set up a new hosting account, and retrieved my files so that I could restore them.
I'm happy that they could do this, and lucky my hosting account is no longer mission-critical as it used to be, otherwise my business would have suffered significantly.

"8/15/2024: So in addition to being fraudsters and thieves, in turns out they are also liars.
I filed a dispute with my credit card company on 8/6/24. On 8/7 I got a call from Cassie A from Bluehost's parent company, Newfold Digital wanting to resolve the dispute. Great!, I thought. After a 15 minute discussion, she agreed to givfe us a total refund. Great again!
A week later I noticed the refund had not yet posted and my credit card dispute was still in a pending status so I called to find out why. It turns out, they actually rebutted our claim to the credit card company.
Absolutely told me one thing over the phone and told the credit card company the very opposite thing.

8/2/2024. 12:43P CST Beware This Company.
Bluehost just took $2160 of my money for services they never provided and are refusing to refund it.
I just got off the phone with Jeph B who, (according to him) is the very highest person on the ladder at the BH Professional Services Design Team, and so whatever complaint I have stops with him. There is, according to him, nobody at BH I can escalate my case to.
As briefly as I can: I signed up with BH to design and build a small e-commerce website for me and unfortunately, paid up front. During the sign-up process, I was told, (apparently by William) that I would be contacted by phone to start the ""intake"" process so that they could do an initial design. I told this [William] that I had digital content (incl. product photos, product descriptions, etc) and that I would be more comfortable submitting my content electronically or on a web form and I was assured I would be able to do that.
I was eventually contacted by Mark who wanted to do the intake by phone; but after a time, realizing it was going to be too time consuming and difficult to convey over the phone, I told him I would much rather submit my information electronically and asked for a form or link. Mark said I could do that and sent me a link to the form.
The link took me to a website Change Request form. I assumed that was the form he wanted me to use. So I filled it out and added our logo and three products to start the design with. Mark contacted me later and said they never got the info. When I told what form I filled out, he said that (the form he directed me to) was the wrong form and urged me to continue telephonically. Well, I don't actually have a couple of free hours to talk on the phone to explain my website, but I tried. 45 minutes in, he asked about our logo which offered to send him; he apparently contacted a supervisor and came back to tell me he did not know how I could submit my content.
Mind you, this is a professional IT web design team and they apparently have no idea how to exchange data electronically. Why would they insist on exchanging graphic design information over the phone rather than electronically?
I finally lost confidence in their abilities to do the job I hired them for and called in to cancel my order and asked for a refund. I spoke to Clark, (I believe) for over 40 minutes explaining that I wanted to cancel and why. I did not record the conversation and I can't quote him verbatim, but I left the conversation with the distinct impression that my refund would be processed within several business days.
Days later, I received a voicemail and an email from Jeph saying he was responding to a request for a ""supervisor call-back."" I was confused by that but was able to take his call shortly after.
I explained the request for refund issue to Jeph and he was very sympathetic and he informed me that the refund policy had to be exercised within 3 days of purchase and my request came in on the fourth day. BUT, he said he was going to argue my case for a refund since we never got anything done.
Later, Jeph called back and said the person I really needed to talk to was William and that he would contact me within 72 hours.
William never called. So I called the team back and was able to speak to Jeph. He explained to me that the final decision on my refund was to deny it because I didn't make the request withing 3 days. I told him that was unacceptable and that I wanted to escalate this issue and asked for a contact.
This time Jeph informed me that there was no one higher than him. I recapped for him his promises to advocate on my behalf, to make my case and to fight for me and asked him, if he was top of the food chain, who was he making my case to?
Well it appears that he and the illusive William are the co-chiefs of the design team. When I asked explicitly who, he told me nobody at BH can override their co-decision. Well in my 64 years, I've never seen an business unit, even a subcontractor) under a large umbrella like BH that does not have a higher authority, so this story is not yet over.

I initially wanted to downgrade the service because I don’t host many websites and the renewal cost was very high. The tech said that was no problem and that they would migrate the sites for $149. I told her to go ahead and put me on the other hosting plan. To my dismay, her information was incorrect in that it was $149 per site! I didn’t want to pay that and to please point the sites back to the original hosting and I would migrate the sites myself. Being inexperienced, I had not backed up the sites recently before I had Bluehost change the hosting plan. I know it was ignorant on my part, but I thought Bluehost had the sites backed up like they used to. Now you have to pay for that service.
On several occasions, the issues were escalated and they completely ignored my issues or gave me vague, inaccurate, and irrelevant answers. It felt like they didn’t care about resolving my problems.
Additionally, their technical support team seemed inexperienced. Instead of fixing the issues, they often made things worse by messing with the files and databases, causing more downtime and disruptions! My websites have been left in a mess, and I’m still trying to get things back to normal.
Overall, Bluehost has proven to be unreliable and unprofessional. Their false advertising and poor service have cost me time, money, and a lot of stress. I would not recommend them to anyone looking for a dependable hosting provider.",2024-06-30,US,customer support,0.4602405130863189,North america,Bluehost

I was never able to get the email to work with my mail client nor have it pushed to devices like my phone or ipad. Needless to say, as a small business owner, the month I lost cost me dearly.

"Where to begin... I have been with bluehost for 3 years and it has cost me $1000s for my business and $10,000's worth my time.

There support is some of the worst ever. Their chat doesnt work correctly and it doesnt notify you that they have responded so you dont respond... but then the chat closes because you didnt respond in like a minute.

If you get passed that their answer is always to contact the plugin company. So you do that and the plugin company tells you to contact bluehost. Then, bluehost makes a change and the issue is temporarily resolved but never permanently... and they dont tell you what they changed.

They are always pushing you to upgrade as well... Almost like the entire goal of their support team is to make sales. Im also suspicious that they do less so that you have more problems and finally give in to upgrading and thinking that its the only thing to solve your problems.

If you are a business owner online and do not want to deal with Website issues EVERY SINGLE WEEK of your business then DO NOT get bluehost.

My most recent experience with their support had them send me a url that described a known issue. There were 3 possible fixes to the issue. I had already tried one, the other one was diving through all my code and the 3rd was to see if my hosting provider has any limits set that could be causing the issue. When I asked them to help with that solution they said it was ""out of their scope""

My website problem momentarily crashes once a month due to the server issues. They have almost yearly scheduled maintenance and they say there will be no impact but there always is.

One time their support even directed me to delete a staging site and it actually deleted my production site in the process. Took a week to resolved and restore backups.

Bluehost has sent us around in circles, blaming our website, blaming our internal systems, blaming Microsoft, blaming our ISP, blaming countless IP addresses. The problem is not any of these. Something is broken in the Bluehost system and they seem incapable of figuring it out.

We have been Bluehost customers for many years and usually get results. It seems the smart people have been replaced by script reading robots that can't think for themselves. What a disappointment!

"I wish I could give 0 stars to Bluehost and that I could add screenshots as a prove of how bad their customer service is. An agent called ""Pratheek"" (there were many other but this was the last one) kept on going on circles asking the same question and solving nothing in the end.
I was asked by sitelock to request bluehost to ""whitelist"" certain IP addresses and I immediately did it and the agent who helped at that time said (as usual) ""It has been done"", and guess what? 4 days later turns out they hadn't done it? Surprisingly? Of course not, this is the beautiful customer service Bluehost offers.

Then I came back to bluehost again! asking for help. The first agent, useless he couldn't do a thing, kept me waiting for more than 20 minutes to later just close the chat on their own.

Then Pratheek, a new agent, I asked him to just ""whitelist"" the IPs and gues what? again I waited for ages as he told me ""I am on it"" ... 10 minutes lates he sent me a link? what? what for? he said for me to do it from my end ... really? you took 10 minutes just to send me a link? If I could do it on my own why would I contact you in the first place. Second, it you ""experts"" couldn't do that task properly the first, second, third time, how possibly a simple user could do it?

Finally, the agent, after nearly 30 minutes of interaction, went ahead and did what I asked to please do from second 1 ...whitelist the ""IP addresses"".

God knows if they did it properly this time. When it comes to bluehost, one can expect nothing less than bad customer service, long waiting times, and inefficient and unskilled agents.

I needed to ask for ""proof"" that it had been done coz honestly I trust 0 Bluehost agents. And of course, any proof could be given.

"Absolutely awful service so far. I switched from SiteGround because BlueHost had some really cheap offers, and I've only had an account for a couple days, and after 1 day, the website is not accessible! I can't login to the wordpress admin! I had to contact the chat support, and they seemed to have no idea what they were doing. Took forever to connect, then were very slow. More frustrating, the first support agent said it was some server problem - but wasn't specific about what was wrong - and that it was nothing to worry about, it would be fixed in a couple hours. Then 4 hours later, it still wasn't fixed! This is a HUGE problem for anyone hosting a website, you can't be down for hours at a time, absolutely ridiculous! Why am I even paying you???

On top of that, the 2nd customer service agent finally told me that my IP address was wrong. Okay, how did it get messed up? Why was it fine the first day and not the second day? What happened?!

Then, she told me it could take 0 to 8 hours to update. Fine, technology can take time...but this is really awful way to start a new webhosting service. Especially after already waiting 4 hours...if it happens again, I will be demanding a refund.

Update: After more than 24 hours, the website is still down! The ""support"" actually seem to have no idea what they're doing.

"I have a list of everything that went wrong in the last 3 weeks because Bluehost is just terrible at everything:
1. Customer service: the worst I have ever experienced. They take ages to respond and even close the chats without consideration, with the issue being unsolved.
2. Every agent gives you different information. I think there have been no less than 20 interactions over the last 3 weeks coz we were desperately looking for help and trying to solve the issue just to face different ""solutions"" given by the agents, which none seemed to work.
3. Cyberattacks: They, until now, haven't done anything regarding cybersecurity (other than of course buying an expensive site lock tool which we were pretty much forced to do as we did not have another alternative) which makes your website exposed and vulnerable to any cyberattack like we had been for a month.
4. Bought sitelock from Bluehost, when purchasing it I followed an agent's instructions together with a link they sent (my website was an add-on, not the main one) and I made sure I chose the correct website and guess what? My purchase went to the wrong website!!!! When I went back to asked what happened and that I needed the tool on my site as it was down already coz of malware, a very unskilled agent said that wasn't possible and that ""I made the mistake"". How was my mistake when I had someone from your team guiding and I did choose my website! Then the agent disrespectfully just closed the chat without any solution. I was shocked by their lack of professionalism. Even when I asked, to simply transferred the tool to my site, the agent again said no is not possible. Later on, on a different chat, we were asked if ""we would like the sitelock to be transferred"" (what the heck? didn't the other agent just said it wasn't possible?).
5. I went back 2 or 3 times about the same issue coz every time it seemed like the ""previous agent"" didn't do what was supposed to do. It was a matter of luck until one skilled agent would be helpful (again, that would take no least than 3 attempts). Why don't you train the agents properly? Their lack of knowledge it's outrageous (at times even I had to tell them what to do from their end coz they simply didn't know what to do)
6. It's nuts, I've had sooooooo many issues with Bluehost coz their lack of empathy, lack of ethics, lack of knowledge from your agent and moreover the lack of consideration for their customers who trust something so important for our business.

It's just really tiring to deal with you guys, I have never encountered a worse company than yours (among all companies, regardless of the type).

And guess what? there is no way you can complain about any of these things.

3) I raised a ticket and they promised to resolve within 24-48 hours later, guess what, no resolution up until now!!
4) On chasing update and progress on case this is the response
The case is still open. You will have to wait for the team to reach out to you. They will reach out to you soon.
I don't even know what's that supposed to mean? My question is not is the case open or closed. I need this resolved now.
4) I asked for cancellations , complaints and or head office phone number and was told there is none. What kind of company has no complaints or escalation phone number????
5) It's a waste of time and money going back and forth and still issue remains unresolved.

"Bluehost is generally pretty good, and while I changed hosting to another company, I was mostly satisfied with their hosting and renewal pricing. However, I found their chat support feature terrible over the three years I was with them. There are too many ""bot/AI"" answers, and it takes a very long time to have a human-to-human ""chat"". This is very frustrating, especially when one is busy. I wanted to permanently delete my Bluehost account (hosting was already cancelled a few weeks ago), and they couldn't provide me with any explanation as to why they couldn't delete it. Their only answer was ""It will be automatically deleted"". They also can't give me any timeframe of when that auto-deletion will happen, leading to more frustration.

"Customer since 2021
It seems the updated prices are decent but their service and support has been so painstaking to deal with had to contact support any time I wanted to know what my renewal prices would be, even paid for fully managed hosting with SSL provided and they let my sites DNS records go offline for around 2 months then blamed me but if I wanted to manage the SSL and hosting why am I paying them 175$/yr to host my website for me if they are just waiting for me to ask for help?

Don't fall for the nice interface and all the free bells and whistles that they throw at you free for a year or at a discount trust me it was around 70$ for the first year next they tell me its 225$ a year or I can do a 2 year renewal instead and get all of my services for only 348... I even filed for a data request of my customer support and account logs and was never responded to, was even sent a promo email from the DNS verified ""e.bluehost.com"" email they use for their marketing emails and keep saying its a scam, they just have no idea what the left or right hand is doing... Its a headache if I realized all of the shady business practices and lengthy terms I would have never signed up. So many customer service interactions that ended up never hearing back and then when I asked to reference the chat transcript which should always be possible for a paying accounts records was told they cant go any further back than a year...

I have been with BH for more than a decade. I first rep I talked to “John” who said the best he could do was 15% discount for three more years of hosting. I asked to speak to someone in Retention and he put me through to “Carl”.

Carl told me he could offer 15% then he said his max discount was 20%. I asked if he was in Retention and he said no, that he and John were at the same level but he could offer more because he had worked at Bluehost for 5 years. He then went on to say “let me look up John to see how long he has been with Bluehost.” Since their length of employment was irrelevant to my situation, I said, “I really don’t think that matters,” and asked him to connect me to Retention.

He started telling me I should hang up and call back because he felt like I was ‘calling him a liar and he did not like people who called him a liar.’

I did nothing remotely of the sort. He kept going on and on that if I didn’t trust him I should hang up.

"I've mostly had good experiences with BlueHost up till this last week.

The blue host server messed up several of my websites, and judging from their recent reviews, it feels like something has happened internally in the last couple of weeks that has caused customer support to turn on their customers pretty flagrantly.

I discovered blue host installed something called Wonder Blocks on websites that blocks access to the theme's editor for two of my sites, and BH says it is the theme's fault. It seems that the product was named appropriately.

They have screwed up my upload folder on a site when fixing a media file issue that was caused because of their server. And in fixing that totally wiped out the CSS. Fortunately, I had backups.

In dealing with customer support today, tech Joe was quite rude; he said the issue was that the domain was not pointing to blue host. I was able to prove that was not true, but it's just not worth going back to them anymore.

I also noticed that if you have a not-so-good experience with a tech, he will put you on hold and not forward you to the survey in order to keep from getting the low ratings they deserve for lack of politeness and or knowledge.

The shame of it is I have recommended bluehost to many clients, so now I will be recommending they all move.

We just kept getting blagged and nonsense mischievous interference. So this morning we literally had to pay a fee to the UK Based firm Nominet to do the transfer for us. Our new hosting company were quite clear this was Bluehost who were blocking the IPS tag change, so we literally had to pay money elsewhere to get our company domain back this morning!. Think long and hard about using Bluehost for your company. They will no doubt respond referring to their 'Escalation emails' blagging, nonsense emails etc etc, and the usual blagging excuses, but in 20 years of managing domain names I've never had such a disgusting, mischievous and stressful experience with a Host company, and its the first time our company website has mysteriously gone offline under their watch with their interferences!

"BEWARE! They tripled a basic hosting package for a client of ours from $179 a year to $536 with no notice. When I went on the site I can see the pricing for our plan is advertised as $119. When I initially contacted support they said there was nothing they could do. They said that renewals are charged at this triple rate so I am effectively being penalised for being a loyal customer. It took over 30 mins on chat to get them to reduce the price but it is still double what I paid the past 2 years, for exactly the same service. I had no choice but to renew as they were either going to autorenew at $536 or delete my clients'service on the spot. They left me with no alternative. I DO NOT recommend this company.

"you don't deserve any star. Bluehost your work ethics is appalling and repulsive. It has been 32 days since I purchased services from you, I still have no accesses to my account not because I forgot my password but because of your faulty system which did not send a verification link and my proof of purchase to my inbox. Why does it take you ages to resolve your error? This is a breach of contract on your part; selling services you can not provide. I presume I need to close my bank account just to dodge a renewal of the subscription being deducted when no services are rendered. Yeah that sounds like how you get by. You are not far from Charles Ponzi... you aware about this issue but do nothing to resolve it. Shame on you.",2024-07-05,ZA,suspended or blocked,0.4947187006473541,Africa,Bluehost
"What has happened at Bluehost? We are not just talking heavy sales pitch. This feels at least like sharp practice and borders on dishonesty. I got several emails urging me to auto renew for various products. The big ticket one was for my 3 year Wordpress Plus Hosting, due to expire mid July. They had changed my plan to something called Wordpress Choice Plus. Noone contacted me about doing that and certainly never gave my permission. We had a 3 year contract. How can they just change it? I got an email telling me to renew Choice Plus immediately in June. And to swich on autorenew. At a price of $719 - more than 3 times what I paid for WP Plus hosting. During the first very long, slow chat, I told them I wanted to stay on my current plan - the one I paid for. Unbeknown to me, they then suspended my website!
Last week, I discovered that my website was down. I spent most of the day on chats with various personnel at Bluehost. Finally, someone agreed to make my website active again. I noticed that SSL and Sitelock seemed to be switched off but she assured me that they would be reset within a few hours. I just checked again now and they are still switched off. And my plan is showing as Wordpress Choice Plus! When I looked at the small print, I noticed that new option has a lot of items removed or they are only included in the price for the first year of a 3 year plan.
And I only just saw that this new plan excludes SSL and Sitelock which had been included in my previous bundle, each now an additional $3.33 per month so the final bill would be nearly $1,000. That also means that my website has been put at risk and is still at risk.
I learned to ignore all the pushes to buy ""privacy protection"" - my contact details are on every page of my website. Final straw. They also sent a batch of warning emails that my domain registration was about to expire and I should turn on auto renew. This was not true. My domain is good for another 15 months. They were trying to get me to ""renew"" a "".online "" domain name similar to mine. A domain that I never bought and never used.
I really don’t know what to do! I was happy with Bluehost, since 2015. Their tech service has been so good. But my trust is burned.",2024-07-04,GB,suspended or blocked,0.3787316083908081,Europe,Bluehost

"Horrible customer service. Incompetent support agents. They are cordial, but useful for nothing but saying that they understand ""how the issue is critical to your business"", while they really dont care.

I migrated from the shared hosting service to VPS as an upgrade because I was promised that this should have improved my site speed:
- Migration was managed in a horible way. No communication, lack of clarity and redundant requests to share already provided info
- After the migration I had a dozen of problems, for which I had to reach out to the support team and waste many hours
- Some agents simply close the chat after reading your case description
- The rest just care about convincing you that it is a domain name propagation issue promising that the issue will be solved in 24 hours after domains propagate. Then in the next 24 hours ther would be another similar execuse or some other totally random opinion that they act on
- Sometimes they cause more problems such my website not loading at all due to some server processes faliure
- It have been weeks now that I have a slower website, and emails on my domain name completely out of service

I also wondered how come they have good feedbacks on Trustpilot: What I noticed is that when agents feel that there is a good vibe, they ask you to leave them a review on Trustpilot. So apparently the good feedbacks are just a sample of selected clients.",2024-07-02,IT,customer support,0.8828780055046082,Europe,Bluehost

"I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Bluehost's customer support. Here’s a detailed account of what happened:

I purchased a hosting plan and domain from Bluehost, and the transaction was initially successful. I was even able to set up my base website. However, after one day, I received an email stating that my order was canceled due to an issue with my credit card, and a refund was processed. The problem is, I used a virtual ghost card for the transaction, which was deleted after the purchase, meaning I couldn't access the refunded amount.

When I reached out to Bluehost support to resolve this, the response I received was unsatisfactory and frustrating:

1. Support Agent Avin’s Response: The agent, Avin, acknowledged that the refund was issued to the deleted virtual card and couldn't be reverted. They claimed that refunds are automated and couldn't offer a solution to redirect the refund to another card or reinstate my order.

2. No Resolution or Compensation: When I asked if there were any plans or compensations to resolve the issue, Avin merely offered to reduce renewal prices for future hosting plans, which doesn't help since I lost both the service and my money.

3. Unfair Treatment: I pointed out that if Bluehost doesn't support virtual cards, they shouldn't accept them in the first place. This oversight on their part has left me without the service I paid for and no way to access my refunded money.

I provided all necessary details and even the transaction receipt, but the support I received was inadequate. The agent’s inability to offer a tangible solution or proper compensation is unacceptable. As a result, I have decided that this will be my first and last time using Bluehost, and I cannot recommend their services to anyone.

This entire experience has been extremely frustrating and has left me feeling unsupported and unheard. I hope others can learn from my experience and proceed with caution when considering Bluehost for their hosting needs.",2024-07-03,DE,customer support,0.7059131860733032,Europe,Bluehost

"Shocking and disgraceful mis-selling. I am not entirely sure how it happened but I was charged for additional services that in no way, shape or form resembled what I needed. The additional security features were not necessary for a site that I was using as a proof of concept page with absolutely no payment models which could have been compromised and so I would never have willingly agreed to a tripling of the amount I thought I had signed up for. Additional security trebling my subscription simply was not necessary. Talk about small print. Beware at all costs. And then don't even get me started about trying to get clarification out of them as I was desperately trying to get a straight answer as to which services I was paying for. All they kept coming back with was the bundle I had paid for and repeatedly would not just answer if they had any domains registered, if they were hosting said website any more or indeed even my emails on another website address. Took about 2 hours to get absolutley nowhere except for them to say they were indeed hosting an automated template of home page I had not authorised. Just shocking sales practice.

"Bluehost Escalated Support is awful.
1. Despite multiple phone calls and emails it took over 1 year for them to include the correct Tax number on my invoices.

2. I paid for a domain renewal on 9 May 2024. and now Bluehost have been unable to provide me with a receipt for payment. I require the receipt for my Tax return. Between 9 May and 26 Jun I have phoned Bluehost 7 times and emailed 5 times. Every time I contact them they say they will look into the issue - but nothing is getting resolved. Every time you email you get a responses from a different person with each saying we will look into my case.
There is no direct method to reach the ""Escalated Support Team"" all you can do is email. I have requested that a supervisor from escalated support call me - guess what - no phone call

3. This is the list of 5 different people who have all emailed me saying they will ""look into my issue"":

Shubhashree J Escalated Support team
Sandesh P. from the Escalated Support Team
Disha D. from the Escalated Support team
Abhishek, U. from Escalated Support team
Lavanya S Escalated Support team

4. How hard can it be to write an invoice for the payment that you received nearly 2 months ago?

5. Here is my support ref number just in case the person who replies to reviews is looking S-2567414

"Your Customer Support people Are TOP NOTCH. However, it is the WRONG-HEADED CHOICE from the President/CEO (Ultimately, this is the person who is responsible for making this decision) that I, nor any of Bluehost's customers, no longer have the ability to go into our accounts and look-up which domains have been charged for renewal, when it was done and how much it was for. I have called in several times just hoping that the previous customer support person was new and didn't know, but it was CONFIRMED TO ME after a couple of attempts, that I cannot do that. Each time I called, I was on the phone for at least 30+ minutes, and probably much longer because your Customer Support ARE GOOD PEOPLE and are trying to find the ability, the solution for me to go into my account and look up this info by probably contacting elder colleagues and eventually managers. Instead, I was told that I have to hold on to each renewal email that was sent to me (hopefully none of those emails hit my SPAM Folder) and refer back to them if I want to know that info so that I can appropriately label which domain and other expenses to designate to specific expense accounts. What kind of service provider would do that to their customers? Reduced service capabilities within our account, yet charge us more?
ALSO, I have noted that Bluehost has been increasing their domain renewals every year over the past several years...it seems...and it is wearing me out...and it is incentivizing me to consider moving to another reasonably priced service provider. I'm not looking for ""cheap"" because you get ""cheap"" service, but a rate that is more reasonable and lines up with the service that I get and expect from a service provider. I don't have a specific ""Date of Experience"", but this experience happened within the past 12 months when you ""updated"" your system and has really been nagging at me for a long time about this. I'm not going to list one of my domains with you, out of concern for retribution. If I'm wrong about not being able to go into my account and look at the renewal details that I had been getting before this ""UPDATE"", then you need to re-train ALL of your customer support personnel and send an email to ALL of your customers the instructions on how to EXACTLY go into our accounts and find these renewal details that we've had access to for years...
I have been a Bluehost customer for many years, about 15-20 years...you are the company that I got started with and have been with all of these years. I hope this review will help initiate change for management to re-look at account capabilities and even consider friendlier price point changes on renewals for domain names.

"I regret to say that my experience with Bluehost has been extremely disappointing. Recently, my website was hacked, and despite my best efforts, I could not recover it. This has been a frustrating and disheartening ordeal.

Security Issues:
One of the primary reasons I chose Bluehost was for their supposed reliable security features. However, my website was hacked, causing significant data loss and disruption. It appears that the security measures in place were inadequate to prevent this breach.

Lack of Support:
When I reached out to Bluehost support for help, the response was far from satisfactory. The support team was slow to respond, and when they did, their solutions were generic and unhelpful. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to get any meaningful assistance in recovering my site.

Data Recovery:
The most frustrating part of this experience was the inability to recover my website. Bluehost's backup services, which I assumed would be a safety net, proved to be unreliable. I found myself in a situation where all my content, design, and hard work were lost.

Rebuilding My Website:
Now, I am left with no choice but to rebuild my website from scratch. This is not only time-consuming but also mentally exhausting. The ordeal has significantly disrupted my business operations and caused me to lose trust in Bluehost as a hosting provider.

In conclusion, my experience with Bluehost has been nothing short of disappointing. The security vulnerabilities, lack of effective support, and unreliable backup services have all contributed to a highly negative experience. I would not recommend Bluehost to anyone looking for a dependable hosting provider.

"I recently encountered significant challenges with Bluehost regarding my website's migration and billing. After my subscription renewed, I contacted them for a domain migration, quoted at $100 for the domain and $150 for migration. I agreed and paid $250 total. Unexpectedly, I was also charged an additional $515 to restore my site to its original e-commerce functionality.

Upon addressing this mischarge, Bluehost admitted the error, agreeing to reinstate my site for 30 days and refund the $150 migration fee. They also assured me that they would refund the $515. After a few days, I received $350 and $150 as refunds. However, this was short of the full $515 by $165. When I followed up, they explained that some services in the $515 were non-refundable.

Feeling frustrated and misled, I was advised by a Bluehost representative to report the issue as fraud to my bank and was promised a follow-up by a manager, which never happened. After a week of no contact, I had to initiate the call myself. They still refused to process the remaining $165 refund, insisting they had resolved the issue by refunding $350.

UPDATE 6-28-2024. Their reply is a lie. They only redunded 60% of the money, and kept about 40% of the money. We cancelled within 3 days after the DNS SERVER code was changed. They refused to do a refund no matter how many times we pleaded with them, hence the angry review you are reading. We lost 10 years worth of documents and were never able to get them back. Very shady company, obvious liars. Run away from this company!!! You will run the risk of having your website, and email crash. Then when you cancel. You will not get all your money back.

In the past year, I have had nothing but problems with their support. One of my websites was built with Weebly which they stopped offering. So I switched to WordPress. The switch was a nightmare and the automated installer did not delete or rename any of my old Weebly files which rendered my site inaccessible. I spent 6 hours between chatting online or live with their support, and all I got was that it was not their problem because they are ""server admins"" and cannot and will not help me figure out what went wrong. I escalated my request to their higher support who were just as dismissive and unhelpful. This is not a way to treat customers especially when the issue took place using their installer.

Boy has it changed. They get you in the door with an incredible hosting price but nickel-and-dime you for additional services and service is not what it used to be.

Most recently, I received an email payment confirmation for a product I did not authorize. In working with Bluehost to resolve the issue and get a refund, both of my websites were deleted. This not only happened once but twice. It took nearly a month to finally resolve everything and get the refunds I thought were due me. Not all reps are knowledgeable and the services appear to be compartmentalized.

The use of my credit card without my authorization, the deletion of my websites, and the poor service was more than enough for me to move both websites and domain I'd had with Bluehost to a new hosting service.
